review
"It starts with an original vision of the hero, has an inspired cast, creates a self-sufficient story and elevates it with a stylized direction that's in line with the film's substance. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The Batman is an ALL TIME BEST FILM. Matt Reeves has crafted the DEFINITIVE take on The Caped Crusader that Pattinson will define for generations to come. Brooding and brutal, I didn’t want it to end."
The Batman isn’t just another entry in a trilogy or a multi-directed Batman starring three Bruce Wayne’s. It’s a love letter to fans who have waited decades for a faithful adaptation of Batman.
"This latest Batman tale is grounded, noir and detective based, and a highly realistic entry into the movie mythos of the caped crusader."
"It’s a part-serial killer mystery, part-superhero adventure, and part-crime drama stuffed in a 3-hour runtime that can feel loaded but never dull."
"Not only does the central plot feel like a rehashing of other films and comic books, the entire movie plays like a patchwork quilt of past works."
A phenomenal take on the caped crusader that will leave you wanting more from this Batman world.
"The Batman becomes less of a full-throttle action romp and more of a detective tale, an arc that hasn’t been filmed before."
"BEST Batman Film yet…. Beautifully made with incredible action sequences, a thrilling mystery, & amazing characters. You can’t get any better than this & wherever smart Reeves goes next door will I."
"With an incredible score by Michael Giacchino, and a backdrop of Nirvana songs to elevate the mood, The Batman is a fantastic film. The acting and fighting sequences will keep audiences on the edge of their seats."
"Matt Reeves delivers a distinctly darker, more intense, frighteningly realistic noir thriller than past adaptations, with an aggressively vengeful Bruce Wayne / Batman and a fear-inducing, mysterious, lunatic Riddler."
"Even with a runtime of nearly three hours, The Batman leaves the audience wanting more. While ultimately fumbling the ending, the characters, performances, plot, and visual appearance leave enough behind to warrant a return to this version of Gotham."
"The Batman is everything a superhero film should be. It’s gritty, stylistic, and most importantly, there’s an intrinsic balance between the action and quiet moments, which Matt Reeves masters superbly through this adaptation."
"In a lot of ways, the disjointed editing in The Batman leaves much for the viewer to process; not enough time exists for key character moments."
"... In this Batman -- very different from Nolan's, Burton's or Schumacher's -- everything seems more appeased, more contained, more... human. [Full review in Spanish]"
"They turned revealing an antagonist's presence to the audience without the victim's knowledge into a suspense-driven art. Here, Reeves taps directly into these tactics to phenomenal effect..."
This is the ultimate Batman movie.
Batman's superpower has always been that he's the smartest guy in the room. ... His title as the Dark Knight Detective has never been showcased on film as well as it was in The Batman.
"It may take three hours for Bruce to learn this lesson, but it's an incredible three hours. It may be fun to watch Pattinson put on black make-up and strap into the Batsuit to fight some bad guys, but there's much more to this story than just that."
"THE BATMAN exceeds my expectations and passes the bar of a reboot. It justifies its own existence with great storytelling, insights into humanity and human society, and powerful performances."
"“The Batman” reaches for an ingenious and compelling new way to tell a story about the thin lines between corruption, greed and nobility — but ever so limply and always just out of its grasp."
Good. Dark Moody. He is Batman.
Matt Reeves’ The Batman brings us closest to the essence of the Batman character than any film adapted from the DC comics have since Tim Burton’s inaugural Batman in 1989.
"The Batman is a brave, bold and brilliant new take on a familiar character and Reeves and Pattinson have done him proud."
"Matt Reeves’ The Batman is a brutal, uncompromising vision that leaves its indelible mark in comic book film history."
"The film casts long shadows with blacks and grays, but the consistent, bleeding flashes of red paint the most intense moments with jarring contrast."
"The Batman is the only comic book adaptation since The Dark Knight to come close to recreating that cinematic achievement, brilliantly blending entertainment with artistry."
"Reeves, it should be noted, assembles a lot of other people’s ideas and themes into this mammoth package. The movie is a triumph of craft and design, but original it ain’t."
"Reeves’ vision is fresh and innovative, building a young (but not brand new) version of the Bat world that is satisfying as a single film, while planting the seeds for a juggernaut franchise."
The Batman transcends an oversaturated genre and gives arguably the best portrayal of the caped crusader yet. Matt Reeves delivers a slow-burn detective noir with a terrifying villain and ever-rising tension. A rare film that I would call a masterpiece!
"Writer-director Matt Reeves knows how to write a blockbuster with brains, and he knows how to film one with visual flare."
"The way that everything is spliced and shaken together, and the mood — and it's definitely a mood — makes this weighty, heavy, sublimely shot, excellently cast, always-engaging blockbuster feel new, and all things Batman with it."
"THE BATMAN shows that even the best intentions may inspire mayhem, cause heck this is Gotham."
"And even though at times the movie seems a little too male-centric, in times when this is almost prohibited, it felt good to feel those testosterone punches in such a quality, entertaining film. [Full review in Spanish]"
How many times can this story be told? Next time pray that the filmmakers aren’t this self-serious about their own vision and that the running time values your time outside of Gotham.
"Lovers of action, fight sequences, digital effects, and mainstream fare may be driven to mental torture. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Matt Reeves is a director with a vision. I'm glad I enjoy that vision, because Batman needs to have good movies."
It is a victory of story and a failure of plot.
"If they had to do one more go on dark, broody, loner, brutal Batman and they decided the selling point was going to be a push into noir... if it had to happen, this is not a bad result. Actually it's pretty good."
"Do we actually need another brooding Bat-flick of this type? Not really -- a little of Vincent Price prancing around as Egghead would be a welcome sight right about now -- but given its assignment, it mostly gets the job done."
"Operatic, simmering, and replete with a smoky noir atmosphere, The Batman is an enthralling package of contradictions."
"more procedural than action movie, a kind of DC Universe version of Seven (1995)"
"Matt Reeves' The Batman features skillful cinematography, an epic score, and a memorable turn or two from the cast, but it's all undone by a remarkably weak screenplay that ultimately turns the film into a repetitive, unengaging, and over-long slog."
"More than a superhero film –there is little ""super"" about the masked hero– it is a contemporary film noir with touches of absolute terror. [Full review in Spanish]"
Reeves succeeds much more in the exposition of situations than in the way in which he manages to solve them. [Full review in Spanish]
"Solid and fleshed out.
[Full review in Spanish]"
"‘The Batman’ is a little long, but it’s an overall surprisingly fun and creepy comic book film that never takes itself too seriously. And Robert Pattinson makes one good emo Batman."
"A solid and adult thriller…with constant rhythm that draws away from the traditional blockbuster.
[Full review in Spanish]"
"Certainly stylish and intense, but ultimately in service of a simplistic story."
"A dazzling, enveloped, night-time spectacle.
[Full review in Spanish]"
"A no man's land that will not comfort the multiplex spectators in search of adrenaline...
[Full Review in Spanish]"
"If any character leaves you wanting more in a good way, it's Farrell. He's very entertaining, something the film strives very hard to be in all its gothic rage. It's his young Penguin who nearly steals Matt Reeves's film."
A Batman that has never been seen in cinema. [Full review in Spanish]
"The action scenes and special effects in The Batman are top-notch, but what makes it all worth watching (on top of your device's Pause button for bathroom breaks) is the strong supporting cast..."
"While the film has been mostly applauded, that for me was where the good stuff ended. First of all, it is interminable. 2 hours and 56 minutes!!!! I mean.that is not necessary."
"""The Batman"" is an installment of an often-depicted superhero that manages to give a fresh take. Both atmosphere and plot are dark and heavy. This may not be the kind of movie for those who lean more towards the MarvelDisney fanfare."
"Overlong but quite strong as an origin story that works on an emotional level by the end. The cast handles this material well, making it more of a detective yarn with hints of commentary about privilege by the end that could've been fleshed out more."
"A fairly good mock up for a Batman film templated as a graphic novel. Its dark and seedy mood is new backdrop for the Batman films but in terms of showcasing what this cape crusader has to offer in story telling, there is nothing new here."
Ugly beauty is the nature of The Batman.
"If it's neither fun nor searing, even those iconic pointy ears might struggle to hear the point."
The Batman shows that Reeves interpretation is one that knows that Caped Crusader was always as famous for his brains as his brawn
It appears that Warner Brothers holy union with HBO MAX has rubbed off on them. diandrareviews
"It remains an action thriller that, with detective intrigue and atmospheric styling, shows an unexplored side of the dark knight in a Gotham City that is always drenched in rain and corruption at night. Full review in Spanish"
"The bigger problem is: the Riddler's menace mostly comes from the Army surplus togs and voice modulation. Otherwise, his demeanor is more like the creepy guy in your sophomore CompLit class who always volunteered to read the Henry Miller excerpts."
"Thanks to Pattinson and Danos compelling performances, as well as Reevess ambitious direction, The Batman is an enthralling thriller and a welcome return for the Caped Crusader."
Matt Reeves The Batman is a riveting and passionately crafted film noir that wears its inspiration on its sleeve while bringing Detective Batman to the big screen.
"hose seeking a grim reflection of our times, will find it; those seeking an escape likely will not. And yet, depressive as it is, the film is electrifying, potent, fun."
Pattinson successfully goes back in time with this character...
"I didn’t think I wanted another Batman movie. But it turns out that Matt Reeves’s The Batman -- starring Robert Pattinson, who played Edward Cullen in the Twilight films -- has the Batman we need."
"Matt Reeves and Robert Pattinson made it look easy to make a new great Batman movie. Greig Fraser, Colin Pharrell and Paul Dano steal the show. The best Gotham out there in a universe full of potential. Full review in Spanish"
"Reeves takes inspiration from numerous comic storylines, mixing and matching to concoct an elaborate tapestry that overflows with iconic characters in differing stages of repute. While not as emotive as his Apes films, the blockbuster spectacle remain."
Always great to see a director with a distinct vision amidst a pool of adaptations. Matt Reeves commits to it and offers a rumination closer to Munich than whacks and pows.
"It doesnt execute every second of its runtime perfectly, but its sense of ambition and drive buoy its entire epic narrative, giving us a reason to get excited about Batman at the movies once again."
"Strange, squalid and sinister, Matt Reeves' version is dark and deadly."
"""The Batman"" offers several great action pieces, but the movie does begin to crumble under its own weight, both in terms of the near-three-hour runtime and its own self-importance."
"Perhaps the biggest indictment of Gotham City is that even the villains feel a burning need to fight crime and corruption. Sex and sleaze are everywhere, apart from the Batcave, which may as well be a monks cell."

"Although Matt Reeves does make attempts to inflect the tired subject matter with some virtuosity, the universe's over-familiarity and essential stodginess overrides any novelty, to my mind, at least."
"Star Pattinson is electric in the role of Batman, expressing so much with his intense silence and reactions to the chaos."
There's a tactile stickiness to the world that clings to you and immerses you.
"It's quite possible ""The Batman"" might be too dark and disturbing for some viewers, but I thought it was pretty terrific."
"This new The Batman is a seductive, and gripping detective tale by way of super-heroism. If this is what blockbuster filmmaking in 2022 looks like, then were off to a great start."
The film I imagine Ricky Fitts would grow up to make after the events of 'American Beauty.'
Matt Reeves’ meandering faux-profound take on Batman spends its over-long runtime telling women to shut up and do as they’re told or face the consequences.
"175 minutes, dark in form and brilliant in execution, that break any labels a preconceived ideas, making the concepto of ""superhero movies"" lose all its meaning despite the masks and capes showing on screen."
"Thrilling from beginning to end, The Batman offers a bleaker spin on Gotham City's beloved hero as he discovers his role in a city just as wounded as him. Full Review in Spanish"
...an above-average comic-book adaptation...
"It verges on camp without committing to it, and it essays the operatic without being able to provide the emotional impetus required."
"Stylish and stark, packed with well-executed action and high-quality performances, The Batman is a welcome addition to the canon of the Caped Crusader. Heres hoping we get to see more of what Reeves, Pattinson and the rest have in mind."
"What this film does achieve, however, is telling a solid new Batman story, one with some pretty compelling twists and a strong point-of-view on who, exactly, the Caped Crusader is. By default, that makes it one of the better Batman movies ever made."
"As for special effects, they are very good, and Greig Fraser’s cinematography is epic."
How you like this iteration of Batman may depend upon how you like your serial murderers served and if you like your casting on a binary of Black and White.
"The cast is fine, with Pattinson adding his own touch to a role now undertaken by six different actors in the past 30 years, seven if you go back to Adam West and the original television show of the 1960s."
"A beefy, stylised approach and committed performances make this take on the Dark Knight worth a look, even if the film fails to break out of the usual cliched lack of light and colour."
"This is everything I could have asked for in a Batman film. I loved the tone, easter eggs, and so much research that went into this. Bobby Patts brought something different to this character that really stood out. I really loved this film."
This is at least in the top three Batman films of all time for me. It was a combination of all of the best elements of the Batman character and Gotham as a city. It blew me away. This was fantastic.
The Dark Knight returns with a more hopeful take on vengeance
"This Batman is as dark, depressed and angry as many of those living in these dark, stressful times. Batman wants revenge, while the villain wants to expose government corruption. Thus, the normal superhero story formula is upended."
"The good guy/bad guy duality — opposite sides of the same coin — has been done to death in past Batman movies. In this one, suffice it to say, it’s taken to startling heights."
"""... a veritable breath of fresh air in an industry glutted with visually banal superhero films with plots that feel written by committee."""
"In a film that’s more about the showing than the telling, Pattinson’s moody edginess fits right in."
"The Batman is not only proof that a comic book movie can be sexy, but an indication that the long-gone genre that defined Hollywood in the 80s and the 90s is making a slow but sure comeback."
"An engaging crime thriller that stars an excellent Robert Pattinson as a brooding, vengeful Dark Knight who dives into the corrupt heart of Gotham City and emerges as a symbol of justice."
"The twists and turns, the grim Fincher feel, the growling bruised Batman and the sadistic Riddler, this big-screen blockbuster is heavy-duty and for Bat-fans with a big appetite."
I love the way they made Gotham City look.
"The Batman sets the bar for the crowded superhero subgenre in a bold, refreshingly auteur-driven manner."
"Reeves self-possessed direction digs into the character with gravitas and precision, making for a reinvigorating return to basics."
"Yes, self-parodic travesties like 'The Batman' could be more original. But even a creative Batman story is still just another Batman story. Isn't it time to give the man a rest?"
"So committed is this film to a reenvisioned Batman look, feel, and face that I never thought of the other films as I watched. It might be the best reboot Ive seen."
"With a super tight first half and a second one that tries too hard to work too many plot lines, The Batman goes back to the character's detective-like roots and makes Gotham dark and grim again. Se7en and Saw blending into a low key superhero movie."
"Pattinson is more a presence than a character, and he fits in with the dark visuals and chilling elements of the story."
"If you strip down the characters iconography deep enough, you are left not with a film about capital-B Batman but rather just a sullen sociopath who dresses up like a bat to fight bad guys."
You can call it brooding -- I call it irritating.
This movie doesn't earn the three-hour running time... It's an okay Batman movie; it's just too long.
"Ultimately, this Batman accepts the thankless, death-defying role he’s stepped into, and the sacrifices that go with it. But that choice would be more compelling if it weren’t framed as a tacit acknowledgement of all the inevitable sequels to come..."
"What I like best is that Matt Reeves has delivered something strikingly unique -- not only for a Batman movie but within the superhero genre as a whole. And while I wasn't initially sold on its length, the movie earns its three hour running time."
Controversial opinion: a Batman movie should not be longer than 'The Godfather.'
"""The Batman"" transcends the superhero genre, honoring the characters roots by becoming an homage to film noir and the hard-boiled detectives of the 1930s and 40s."
"The Batman isnt just one of the best Batman films, its also one of the best comic book films to date."
"It's early in the year, but Reeves' lumbering misfire is a strong contender for the great overreach of 2022. This is not my Batman."
The city of Gotham just feels very grounded and dangerous.
The Batman is everything a superhero movie should be.
"It's the kind of fat, clumsy imposter that a real Batman movie would tie up and leave at the scene of a crime in order to limit the damage it might do to itself and others."
The movie’s inability to imagine its superheroes and supervillains with any meaningful psychological identity is of a piece with the failure to imagine ordinary people with any degree of individuality.
"The Batman is a triumph where we see the Bat find love, hope, and a sense of understanding that he is not alone in this world."
"It’s not too surprising that this is Reeves’s film, since the recent Planet of the Apes trilogy is among the most rich, complex, and well-crafted franchises in cinematic history."
"An emo-thriller take on the world of Gotham, The Batman explores the mysteries of the dark underbelly of the city with expert world-building and unexpected humor."
"On the whole, The Batman satisfies. It may continually remind you of other films, the aforementioned work by Mann, Fincher and Lumet, but at least this magpie director is pinching from the best."
"There's so much to love about Matt Reeves' The Batman: the characters, the cinematography, the stellar soundscape, the incredible world-building. The screenplay could have been a little tighter, though."
"The Batman may not knock The Dark Knight from its perch, but it is a fully imaginative reworking of the Detective Comics era, lifted by muscular performances."
"I was pleasantly surprised. It's not the Nolan movies, but for heaven's sake better than Affleck...I think Pattinson does a good job with it."
"It left me curious as to what's to come next. It's got that power, speed and strength to it..."
A stylistic masterpiece. More pulpy than Saturday morning fun.
"A wonderful send up to pulp detective comics Batman has origins in. Dark and grown up, but not afraid to be weird and silly as well."
"Reeves, Pattison and the talented cast and crew have created a crime/action/drama extraordinaire. A close to perfect superhero film that nips at the heels of the untouchable The Dark Knight."
"Theres a good two-hour film buried in this bladder-busting, three-hour mess."
"While it might not be the greatest Batman story ever told, its good to see someone attempting to try something a little different with the character and the genre  and that alone means The Batman has an excellent defence for its existence."
"The trend of turning Batman and everything around him increasingly darker, which began with Keatons Batman, has reached its logical culmination in The Batman. Robert Pattinson is absolutely tremendous, vanishing completely into the role."
"Stellar cinematography and production design stand out, fantastic visual effects and a strong score from composer Michael Giacchino likewise resonates."
'The Batman' is a darkly satisfying portrayal of the masked crime-fighter and a refreshing interpretation better aligned with 'Brightburn' than anything produced by Zack Snyder.
"The Batman is all the fun youve been hoping for. Choosing to be gritty and real just as Marvel zooms off into the Multiverse was a smart choice, and provides a crowd-pleasing first chapter to a new franchise."
Robert Pattinson shuts all his haters up with a vulnerable and terrifying performance in Matt Reeves’s The Batman.
The Batman is both too dark and not noir enough.
"Totally didn't need the shot of Robert Pattinson eating blueberries in slow motion, but I still liked it."
The film gets a good retro look that fits the story  as most of us know it  giving the proceed a dark and brooding look and feel.
"This is a goth Batman. He's also a furry. ""Furries create their own animal character (a fursona) which functions as their avatar within furry communities."" So, a goth furry, with Catwoman making up his furry community of two. It's fairly fun but too long."
"Despite the weight of its long-running time and some unwanted subplots, The Batman offers plenty to celebrate as one of the best versions of the character."
A near operatic morality play that isn't afraid to question its hero or show his weaknesses.
"Pattinson is one of the premier weirdos of his generation, yet The Batman restrains him and his co-stars into generic crime drama roles."
"Without rising above the films that influenced it, this impeccably crafted noir thriller successfully presents a promising new take on the Batman universe."
"The Batman may be overstuffed, but the strong cast and impeccable direction make the film an impressive love letter to the DC hero."
"Matt Reeves' oh-so-serious Batman presents a fresh, complex and inventively retooled entry in a long and crowded superhero franchise mostly dominated by supervillains far more interesting than its titular hero."
The Batman ultimately feels like a competent adaptation of the source material refined and emboldened in the image David Finchers Zodiac. Reeves has a knack for memorable shots and incorporates interesting visual perspectives into his Batman
Reeves has made the first Batman movie that has the feel of the best Batman comics.
"(Matt Reeves) transcends the clichés with a masterful, often tense and noir-as-night twist on the mythology that ranks with Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight as the best of all the Batman movies."
"The Batman is more Blade Runner than Batman Begins, but this is damn good, consistently surprising filmmaking, and it all works."
"It’s a hellish fusion of ideas and genres, built on the foundations of some of the best comic book stories but still wholly its own creation, brimming with emotion and angst and tragedy -- and yet, this is not a film to be endured. It’s to be enjoyed."
"Despite its flaws, Matt Reeves has marshalled one of the smartest and most mature comic book adaptations in memory. The film is strongest in its first half but the double act between Wright and Pattinson sustains throughout."
"Superhero reboots have become tellingly frequent, as if being jolted back to life by increasingly desperate electro-shocks. For all the consummate care expended on The Batman’s beautiful surface, its substance subsides through familiarity."
"In addition to Pattinson, Wright, and Farrell (whose Penguin series cant arrive soon enough), nearly everyone else in the impressive cast likewise brings their A game."
"Matt Reeves gets caught between not being fun enough while also refusing to lean fully into the darkness offered by his premise, creating something that's undeniably watchable but also very serious and safe."
"The underlying plot becomes off-puttingly complicated, the tone remains annoying one-note, and one crucial climactic scene goes on so long you think it’s never going to end."
"Even without the overdone backstory, Pattinson's Batman is a fully realized, deeply-moving character who is immensely interesting to watch."
The Batman is inarguably the darkest cinematic vision of the Caped Crusader  and one that prods at the foundations of heroism.
"The Batman is a terrific individual dissertation in the legacy of the Dark Knight. Brooding, brilliant, and breathtaking, The Batman hits that elusive sweet spot between a made-for-the-masses popcorn flick and a deeply complex political thriller."
"A smart, thrilling, engaging, and entertaining ride through a Gotham City that I hope to see revisited many more times."
"As expected of a director of Reeves calibre, The Batman is an exceptionally well-made film on a technical level, but in its critical final act, it loses sight of its procedural tone and instead gets distracted by the need to check numerous other boxes."
"While it doesn't redefine the Caped Crusader, Reeves and Pattinson provide a solid outing into Gotham. The film could probably be about an hour shorter and have shaved a plot line or two, but it's bound to make some Bat-fans very happy."
"...deserves credit for shining the spotlight on the underbelly of Gotham, but the storytelling in The Batman is like Bugs Bunny meaning to have taken that left turn at Albuquerque; a meandering foray down a dark rabbit hole that isnt entirely necessary."
"Stylish and well-cast, but monotonous and with an overlong running time and not enough suspense or thrills."
"No snark, no spandex pantomime spectacle. Just noir mystery, Pattinsons sad recluse a detective in a cesspit of corruption. Relentlessly grim, all darkness and despair, not escapist but of our time."
"If the film falls short of greatness, because Reeves didnt know when to cut and run, it is, in its final extended form, a superior comic book adaptation and brooding thriller in its own right."
"The Batman is the triumph we hoped for, and the film DC have desperately been in need of for a long time."
"A gritty and dark noir crime thriller that plays like David Fincher's ""Seven."" Pattinson, Kravitz, and Wright are the dynamic trio in Matt Reeves's definitive Batman film."
"In The Batman, Pattinson is one of the best portrayals of Batman on screen."
"""The Batman"" is a crime film, influenced by film noir and police procedurals. It feels unique, and it manages to differentiate itself from the comic book movies that are usually released in theatres every month. Full review in Spanish."
"Except for a new cauldron of actors, this lengthy and exceptionally grim load of PG-13 (huh?) cinema gives the franchise that keeps trying to reinvent the wheel little to distinguish itself from the previous rest."
"As a standalone police procedural, it works quite well, but as a franchise reboot it’s not enough of a reset."
You could say every era gets the Batman it deserves. Reeves has made an absorbing entertainment where its rainy streets and perturbed faces speak to our intensely uncertain days.
Previous Batman movies have had noir elements. The Batman feels more like film noir with Batman elements.
"Has very few identifiable ""flaws""; it's more that at a certain point, it's hard not to feel ground into submission."
Greig Frasers A+ cinematography drenches the screen in heavy horror-noir vibes as fear rules Gotham in this fantastic new Batman chapter.
"In The Batman, Pattinson and Reeves create a superhero spectacle for audiences that goes above and beyond the norm. In lieu of a fatigued origin story, we get an evolution."
"In the end, this may be the best Batman movie.
But it also may be the least entertaining Batman movie."
"Robert Pattinson and Matt Reeves return the caped crusader to his roots as an obsessive detective with this complex, intriguing reboot."
"When it comes to elevated powers, The Batman has a rare one: it is not a super hero movie."
"Director/co-writer Matt Reeves doesn’t present anything especially revolutionary in his approach here, but he incorporates some notable stylistic influences and places an emphasis on detective work."
"The Batman is a product of this time and place, in other words. A shame that this time and place are so stupid."
"There's more to The Batman than its style, but I should say something about the film's prop and tech design, which is so good and fun."
The Batman lives and dies on its characterizations. They’re pretty good.
Gotham City’s favorite vigilante has long been known as “the World’s Greatest Detective.” Matt Reeves is the first director to truly realize that on screen.
"Lensed by two-time Oscar nominee Greig Fraser, Gotham has never looked so gritty, moody and beautiful... Michael Giacchino's haunting score is fantastic, orchestrating each scene with a balance of intensity and intimacy."
"Listen, The Batman is a solid outing for DC. But, by focusing on the early, comic-book detective iteration of Batman, it sacrifices some of the potential fun of the character."
"I really, really enjoyed this movie and... I definitely wanted to see it"
"At its best, The Batman drips with shuddering dread. Too bad the movie concludes with a half-hearted attempt at a hopeful resolve, a letdown after so much dark commitment."
Matt Reeves delivers a near-perfect film that’s only occasionally limited by its excesses.
"An emotional, noir, David Fincher-esque take on the iconic character."
This film is on the level of Nolan’s masterful trilogy and transcends the comic book genre in a rather impressive fashion.
"For fans of the grittier DC movie entries, The Batman may be too sardonic. For those of us who missed freaky Batman, however, it’s an interesting turn, even if it’s not exactly a delight."
"Coming exactly 100 years after F. W. Murnau’s still-disturbing Nosferatu, The Batman doesn’t earn being called artistic decadence. Its depiction of social horror isn’t fully imagined; it never gets to the core of spiritual repulsion that Murnau touched"
"Owing to the first-rate cinematography, and for Pattinson's brooding and emotionally bruised superhero, The Batman isn't the drudge it otherwise might have been."
"What Reeves has done here should be taken as a remarkable accomplishment. In an era of studio properties, especially superhero movies, aiming for the safest possible outcome, The Batman is a legitimately out-there film."
"The film gets off to a slow and slightly tedious start, taking far too long to get going... However, once the investigation into these murders deepens, the pace picks up and the film gets really fun."
"It’s not the grand synthesis Reeves may have hoped for, nor can all the villains put together live up to Heath Ledger’s Joker. But if you’re after a full meal of a movie, you shouldn’t leave feeling hungry."
"Weve seen him campy, broody, neon-splashed, comic book-styled, grittily realistic and whatever it was Zack Snyder was attempting, but this is a whole other Batman, altogether."
"The result is unexpectedly welcome, a comic book movie that feels buoyed by a mixture of humility and fidelity to its cartoon origins, and which stumbles only when it grasps at being more."
"Somehow, through dark magic and incredible craftsmanship, The Batman has managed to bring some truly fresh and invigorating elements to the franchise that are sorely needed."
Reeves delivers clearer action sequences than any previous Batman director. Even better is the way the Riddler is revealed as a mirror image of the superhero who busts Bruce on his privilege.
"The Batman has some stylish trappings and some interesting ideas. But under the mask, weve seen it all before."
"Absolutely everything that writer/director Matt Reeves and cowriter Peter Craig put in the script works. But to be clear, thats works in the sense of how I kept my Mitsubishi Galant working until it caught fire in a parking lot."
"The Batman is exactly the gritty crime thriller it was selling in the trailer, but it is not the deep, dark detective story come to smash your notions of what a superhero movie can be."
"Created alongside Dune cinematographer Greig Fraser, this may be the best-looking Gotham City flick of all time."
"However bleak and disturbing the movie might be, The Batman's grittiness is in service of an unexpectedly optimistic message, and Reeves brings some much-needed glimmers of hope to this otherwise gloomy picture."
"My quibbles with the runtime aside, I think audiences going in expecting a more grownup mystery drama than a tentpole action movie will love The Batman."
A bold vision of the character that reboots the franchise in an exciting new way.
"Knowing what kind of Batman this is (and, crucially, isn’t) is key to getting the most from this long, dark story."
"It's not my favorite take on Batman or Bruce Wayne, but done well enough that I have more positives than negatives. A good to great film."
The Batman proves to be monotonous murk.
"Rarely do I use the word ""perfect"", but I wouldn't change a thing about ""The Batman"". It's an absolute ""must-see more than once""."
"Wants to be critical of Batman as a vigilante who uses excessive force and use the Riddler to comment on white male radicalization, which may actually feel newly relevant after the freedom convoy, but the points don't land as hard as Batman's fists."
"The standout performer among the cast is Kravitz, whose Catwoman is constantly keeping all the men in The Batman on their toes."
"Beneath the rubber ears, he’s all granite-chinned and haunted eyes. Off duty, he’s a tragic, wan, raccoon-eyed Bruce Wayne. He hurts. He suffers. And that’s OK, because his Batman is the tense center of a whirl of well-cast characters."
"Reeves delightfully returns this property to the realm of adult sensibilities as far as mood, tone and characterization are concerned."
The Batman is a smart and uncompromising work that makes the familiar seems fresh and which does have more on its mind than simply extending a valuable [intellectual property].
"Although it does disappointingly go over the top on occasion, there’s just too much depth and style to The Batman for it to be anything other than a success."
... Just because it's grim doesn't mean it's a drag: this is exhilarating filmmaking on every level.
"It occurred to me that The Batman feels, in atmosphere and pretensions, exactly like what was so sublimely spoofed by 2017's The Lego Batman Movie. It isn't every day that the target of a parody shows up five years after the parody itself."
"The shame of it is Reeves' hewing to all those established norms negates the elements of the film that do feel more revelatory, creating a kind of mish-mash of ideas rather than an engaging whole."
"Pattinson deserves another two movies to grow into the character. He looks great in the suit, and he's got the broodiness of Batman down pat. He just needs more time to be the man under the mask and remind audiences he's human."
"In an era of superhero gluttony, in which these familiar stories, characters, and visuals tend to bleed together, The Batman holds the rare distinction of creating and embracing its own identity."
"Reeves strikes closer to the core of Batmans ethos than any other live-action depiction, a noir mystery ripe for Gothams murky confines."
"The Batman just gets darker and more oppressive. This is the pandemic caped crusader, and he has a personality disorder."
My reaction may be mixed but there's lots to love about Mat Reeves' The Batman. It owes more to the likes of Zodiac or Road To Perdition than to common heroes-in-tights fodder ... here's my video take!
"... so bleak and cynical that it too often forgets to be fun, which would be forgivable if the central mystery was more compelling or if the films thematic complexity matched its technical ambitions."
THE BATMAN is not a superhero movie. Reeves eerie tone and subject matter plays more like a horror movie. Matt Reeves has crafted a different cinematic interpretation in THE BATMAN that merits a place in the DCEU with Robert Pattinson as the vigilante.
"The capable cast all inhabit their roles with panache, but some of the film's potency is lost with certain unconvincing narrative twists and a few characters who feel stale."
"Only more time under the cowl will confirm it, but based on this performance alone, Robert Pattinson may be the best live-action version of The Dark Knight yet."
"The question is not whether or not The Batman is smart and well put together; undeniably, it is. The question is whether or not you want this particular film about this particular character."
"While its action is appropriately theatrical and its mystery appropriately intriguing, in the end this is a film that lives and thrives on its thematic resonance. It lives in the brain instead of passing through it."
"The Batman takes the best of what we have read, watched, and listened to for the better part of a century, and crafted one of the greatest depictions of the character on the big screen to date."
"If this film effectively repurposes our shared trauma into something more palpable and satisfying, then maybe Matt Reeves finds something that eludes most Batman films of the past. He makes him relevant."
While The Batman might tread familiar ground... there’s enough that’s distinctive here to ensure it makes good on its promise.
"Pattinson makes a great Batman, but he makes an even better Bruce Wayne."
"Matt Reeves has a strong artistic vision that's worth seeing for fans of the Dark Knight. The movie is not a home run, though."
"This is a redemptive view of a superhero as sociopath, trying to balance moral courage against a society that believes youre a chump if you do so. Riddle me this  what society does that sound like? Theater tip ... an empty bladder  full experience."
"Batman Begins, again."
Pattinson's one-note performance isn't the fundamental problem. The problem is that it attempts to embody the current ethos of deconstructing systems we once believed represented the common good  and that includes the system that created Batman.
A rock-solid building block that re-establishes the hero for its next decade or so of direction.
"'The Batman' runs too long and could use a Pow, Bam, Whamm, Thwapp, Biff, and Zok, but this is a worthy superhero-detective story."
"Pattinson shares several (although too few) scenes with Kravitz, and their flirty chemistry enlivens every one of them."
"W hat’s wacky, woke and cast like an indie movie? Answer: this Batman reboot."
"This is only the beginning of a run of new Batman tales. The best thing is, it makes us want to see what happens next in this dark and angry place."
"I didn’t want a retread of the past or another origin story. Instead, I got something different."
"Reeves’ bold and enthralling The Batman marks a radical shift in direction, even from Christopher Nolan’s (comparatively) more grounded trilogy."
"The Batman is a standalone film that packs in all the ingredients for a delectably dark mindbender featuring the caped crusader, who is more human than ever."
"The film has some exceptional qualities. Its biggest issues are a bloated, unrefined script and a misguided final act."
"While the film's runtime leads to some bloat, Reeves' noir-influence The Batman stands out as the darkest and most visually inventive film starring the caped crusader."
"At three hours, THE BATMAN flew by. Warner Bros. will have a huge hit at the box office."
"I went into our screening expecting a bloated, too-heavy-on-the-action, overly violent, 175-minute ho-hum affair. THE BATMAN is none of these."
"The Batman both feels like a terrific achievement given the comic book saturated climate we live in, and a disappointment for it struggles to retain its identity and flex more than a few muscles."
"When the villain here says 'we're not so different', it actually carries weight. Pattinson's Batman is a despondent, disturbed, destructive presence."
"The Batman is as good as a Batman movie has ever been, or possibly ever can be."
"[The Batman] is very long, relentlessly intense, murmured more often than spoken, and photographed, by Greig Fraser, with a glowering gorgeousness that must be seen to be felt. It’s also enthralling and tailored to our time."
The Dark Knight continues to get darker and darker.
"Even with multiple sequels and spin-offs planned, there likely wont be another superhero movie that looks and feels like this for quite some time."
"Visually, Reeves’ film is spectacular, full of graphic tableaux and painterly touches. It never rains but it pours in his Gotham, a city mired in grey, abandoned by the sun."
"Matt Reeves innovative makeover reimagines The Batman as a modern-day noir murder mystery, abandoning the action genre."
"Lacking in light and shade, and definitely overlong, The Batman is nonetheless a compelling and well-performed detective story that, yeah, happens to star a man in a batsuit."
"What carries the film are the sly intricacies of The Riddler’s misdeed... and the stunning set designs that range from the crowded, rain-slicked streets of Gotham to the gaping Batcave and an Edward Hopper-styled diner lit in green neon."
A compelling hard-boiled mystery with a detective who just happens to wear a cape and cowl.
"That willingness to play with the pop art of it all, even as it’s very much doing a modern, grim-and-gritty blockbuster thing, is the truest joy of The Batman."
Not that The Batman doesn't have its moments. It's just that it only has about 90 of them. I actually liked Robert Pattinson's smoldering broody routine (the first 20 times I saw it).
The 'most anticipated film of the year' proves to have been worth the wait. Peeling a big black onion for almost three hours -- that's what you're getting with The Batman.
"The grittiest, gloomiest, and most pitch-black of the entire Caped Crusader canon, The Batman expands the compelling mythology with a neo-noir approach and very gothic Gotham look."
"There's an awful lot going on in ""The Batman,"" maybe three movies worth. But Reeves is a capable storyteller, and the actors are good enough to keep the momentum going."
"Even as it may neglect or deviate from aspects of canon in minor ways, it pulls off a few essential new tricks. Perhaps the most essential? It's actually a movie about Batman."
"There is shuddering set-piece after set-piece with nothing innovative of note. Usually you do, at least, get (lame) jokes between the action sequences but this is so humourless and deadly serious you don’t even get that."
"Matt Reeves made good on his promise to deliver a fierce and suspenseful Batman detective noir. The film is deliberately somber but not an entirely joyless affair, filled with stunning shots and thrilling action."
One of the strongest elements of the film is how much new ground and fresh ideas permeate The Batman with little or no retread of the character history
The Batman is an amazing world of Gotham. I want to see more from this world of Gotham.
"Dropsical with self-importance, and setting a bold new standard in joylessness..."
"Reeves nails Batman's raison d'etre. The personal grievance, married to intimate violence, is satisfying."
"When Christopher Nolan was directing the Dark Knight trilogy, he tore into the Batman mythos with fervor, whereas Reeves just seems to be lackadaisically marinating in misery."
"The Batman -- the man, the film -- is so hard-boiled it's nigh on turned to stone. Alas, the writing is nowhere near strong enough to support this weight."
"This caped crusader is young, tortured, and frightening in a way that the character has never been."
"This very special episode of 'CSI: Gotham' tries to mimic all the moves from David Fincher's 'Seven,' but has a lot more in common with junky '90s knockoffs like 'The Bone Collector' and 'Kiss The Girls.'"
"Relentless, dark, diabolic, and dynamic is Director Michael Reeves iteration with Robert Pattinson as a subdued Caped Crusader uncovering sordid clues from each characters past, and it works."
"A grim, gloomy, lugubrious, violent tale of vigilantism in a dystopian city mired in corruption and cynicism...There are plenty of praiseworthy elements in 'The Batman,' but as a whole it comes across as extremely depressing and self-indulgently labored."
"It’s the kind of superhero movie that, along with something like Spider-Verse, should be the standard-bearer for the genre going forward."
"Matt Reeves finally gives us the first Batman movie ABOUT Batman, with no villain stealing his spotlight. A captivating film noir in which Gotham is filtered through the mood and aesthetic of Se7en."
"We've become so used to superhero movies with a few good sequences sandwiched between lackluster stuff that I wonder if moviegoers are ready for a beautifully constructed one with a beginning, middle and end. That would be ""The Batman."""
"With a sweeping soundtrack, actual detective work, and a surprising turn by a capable Pattinson leading a great cast, this Caped Crusader is learning to be better than he was yesterday in a city losing hope... a reconstruction of the superhero genre?"
"Robert Pattison, following up performances in The Lighthouse (2019), Tenet (2020), and The Devil All the Time (2021), continues to expertly plumb the depths of men with nothing left but anger, vengeance, and violence"
"The problem is that the movie, which hampers its value with a bloated running time of 176-minutes, never feels fresh, original, or essential."
"176 minutes is a long time to go without laughs. And once you've settled into Matt Reeves universe of Gotham, you kind of brace yourself for whatever might be around the corner, its definitely not a joke."
Batman is officially a buzz kill ...
"If previous Batman movies were a tad too upbeat, festive, short, and well-lit for you..."
"Is this Batman THE Batman? Hard to know this early, but Im sure Reeves and Pattinson will be back for more. Theyve accomplished something special here, a Bat with a real brain."
The Batman is a boiled down detective noir that scales back the theatrics of previous versions to concentrate on Bruce Waynes personal issues and gritty action scenes.
Reeves cleverly subverts the obvious inklings of an origin story in exchange for a brooding and bleak bat-noir that reinvigorates the cape crusader.
