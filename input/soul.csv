review
Soul feels like a midlife crisis movie that has adults questioning their lives and children distracted by the bright colors.
"If anything, Soul is guilty of over-ambition. The wizardry and wit are there, but it lacks Pixar’s usual deftness in making complex themes sing for youngsters."
"A classic Pixar feature, with the trademark emotionally powerful third act; a heartwarming, sweet, tear-inducing score; and a relatable, profound, well-explored story about our own soul and the meaning of life."
"I wouldn’t consider Soul a unanimous success, but its potential is undeniable. The impact and possibility this movie projects for future films at Pixar is key."
Is it among the very best Pixar has to offer? No. Did it make me think and feel deeply the way that a Pixar film often does? Absolutely.
"...it should help convince them that even if it’s not something they are great at, all they have to have is passion for its pursuit and that will be more than enough to satisfy their soul’s enrichment."
"An existential comedy that delivers beyond generic religious, psychological, life goals and ideals... [Full review in Spanish]"
"Soul is a thoughtful animated family film with a tender nature, some sweet laughs, and an even kinder heart."
"Soul may not match the top-tier titles in Pixar’s formidable filmography, but this emotive exploration of human existence is just as engrossing all the same."
"Pete Docter’s gratifyingly inventive Soul is anchored in a similar site of broken chances and eluding hope, making it one of the most defining films of this year."
"“Soul” is a heartfelt story about second chances and finding real purpose in your life. It’s about obsessions, mortality, and finding the true qualities that make each of us tick."
"While there’s plenty of zany action, including talking animals and a body swap, Soul is one of Pixar’s quietest, most contemplative, and gentle films. And for anyone who has questioned why you’re here, this will pack an emotional punch."
"The film teeters on that fine line between genius and curiosity, going in directions that are unexpected even for a studio like Pixar. The film is confirmation that Pixar are still a company that do things their way, and that can only be a good thing."
"Beyond its sillier humorous notes and efficient, fast-paced explanations of complex worlds, Soul rewards contemplation."
"Soul is not just another masterpiece in the Pixar collection, but it is also the studios most thought-provoking and one of their most innovative features theyve made."
"The film looks exceptional, the music sounds amazing, yet even with all the technical bells and whistles, Soul never forgets the emotional core and experience of its characters. It's a film that tells a story at a sensory level."
An impressive technical achievement. [Full review in Spanish]
"The truth is that the film is presented as entertainment, but not so naively. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Only half a good movie. When mucking around with unfunny body-swap nonsense, it falls flat. When pondering the deep passions that give us reasons to live, it excels."
"It's comedic, moving and the animation is pristine. [But] [i]t's like animation meets Get Out, meets Magical Negro."
I wish the film focused on and channeled more of its energy into that relationship and Joe's own life rather than his bump-in with 22.
"Soul [is] a wildly ambitious, sometimes brilliant, gorgeously animated (in every sense of the word) film, all while breaking one of Disney/Pixar's biggest glass ceilings: an animated film featuring a Black lead character."
[Soul] opens as a metaphysical theme park and morphs into a slapstick body-swap comedy ... It's a quietly joyous send-off to a relentlessly bleak year.
It's solid Pixar working their magic with a couple rough spots but nothing to truly sour the experience.
"Soul cannot make its discrete parts work as a whole of something when it feels like it is stuck in its own ""Great Before""."
"With a simple, yet life-altering moral, wrapped in the greatness that we now expect from Pixar, it's no surprise as to why Soul is achieving a momentous amount of awards, while simultaneously being a perfect family voyage."
An animated film that infects me when it tackles with sensitivity and grace a rather clever concept that celebrates the value of human life. [Full review in Spanish]
"Even if the story hits too many familiar beats to completely succeed, the animation is absolutely stunning."
The film beautifully illustrates the communion of life's spark and human purpose. [Full Review in Spanish]
The shape-shifting keeps Soul light on its feet and keeps your eyes wide open.
"An animated masterpiece about a soul's adventure that will get you thinking and talking about the life and the afterlife, your passions and purpose, and the spark that sets it all going."
The film's multilayered charms - a Pixar hallmark - seamlessly blend heart and humor in a package that parents will be able to enjoy alongside their kids.
Directors Pete Docter and Kemp Powers manage to land these [existential] ideas. [Full review in Spanish]
"A smart, tender and contemplative piece of stunning filmmaking all on its own terms."
"This may be Pixar's most 'adult' film, in terms of its themes, its mostly middle-aged characters, its sometimes experimental and -- yes -- jazzy animation (heaven is run by characters who are nothing but squiggly lines), and its soundtrack."
"With its fragmented narrative, it feels almost like a shorts collection jazz riff on the theme of existence and metaphysics, plus quite a few of the jokes feel extremely American-specific and won't translate well for international audiences."
Pixar does some serious soul-searching embarking on an existential adventure that'll go to infinity and the great beyond!
"Even with some wrong notes, Soul has enough going for it to give it a reasonably toe-tapping recommendation. Just don't expect it to come together like a great piece of jazz."
Soul's overall message in conjunction with the surrealness of the afterlife and vibrant New York atmosphere leaves you with things to contemplate and appreciate.
"What follows is an absolute delight. It will make any viewer cherish the life they have and want to live it more fully, every single day, ideally with lots of laughs along the way."
"'Soul' has magic, music and meaning."
"Soul has a perfectly good message. Still, once director Pete Docter and co-director Kemp Powers, who both wrote the script with Mike Jones, lead us through how things work, they fall back on convention."
Soul is beautifully structured and animated. Pixar remains undefeated at putting me through the emotional wringer.
"It is the story, and the message within it, above anything else, that is Soul's best achievement."
It shortchanges itself at every turn by overextending itself.
Preaching to a mismatched choir that deserves a sermon that's more thoughtful and allows for greater individual interpretation than what is offered. But the animation is terrific!
One of Pixar's strongest works. [Full review in Spanish]
It's got a bebopping spirit that's difficult to resist.
[There are] small moments that exude credibility but... go hand in hand with others that don't. [Full review in Spanish]
"...it would be hard to argue against Soul being one of 2020's most comforting, pleasurable films..."
"Soul feels timeless in the way most Pixar films do, rooted in a stylistic place but boasting themes and ideas, and magical worlds, that stretch beyond the now."
"Not since the Beat movement has ""soul"" been so easily sold to all (meaning white hipsters)."
"Like life itself, Soul is a messy and chaotic affair; a big bang where the physical and metaphysical collide."
"There's a lot of deep concepts in Soul, some of it's too complex for kids, but there is a mix of laughter, sweet music, mind bending animated visuals, and a message to live for today, not tomorrow."
Soul has a high concept premise and some truly gorgeous depictions of the afterlife and spirituality.
"The meat of the film is thoughtful, inventive, enlightening, but still quite heavy ... Foxx and Fey are a fearsome duo behind the voices, providing the right notes of humor and deep emotional resonance that will make you feel good by end credits."
"As per the Pixar mandate, there are laughs and plucked heartstrings, but Soul is after something deeper-an unusually curious examination of why we are the way we are..."
"It would be doing a disservice to everyone involved with Soul to say what they've done is simple. Nearly everything about the film is memorable and thought-provoking, a rare thing no matter what type of story is being told."
"Like the best Pixar films, Soul confronts a very ordinary existential crisis."
"Doctor, Powers and Mike Jones have written a sweet, simple, happy, sad, soul-stirring story that reminds you that every now and then that it's important to stop and smell the flowers."
"Even with the film's bid for a suspension of racial disbelief, the racial-passing narrative in the second act of Soul is acutely bizarre."
Soul offers a soulful and sparkly treat of being alive and the joy of living..
"The writing, music, and voice work made it all punch harder than the normal Pixar joint."
Soul offers a surprisingly heady philosophical message to a distressed generation that is trying to find purpose through meaningful work.
"With a mixture of slapstick humor and gorgeous LSD-trip type images, the geniuses at Pixar pull it off."
"An entertaining, exuberant effort about our existence with comedic shenanigans, deep thoughts and wondrous imagination."
"It's funny, and it's imaginative, but it's also just very, very real."
"'Soul' is another landmark film from Disney Pixar, likely to sweep next year's animated film awards."
"The movie is loaded with narrative and visual imagination. As is quite common in Pixar films, it may be just a cartoon, but it has plenty of soul."
The magic of Soul is how it marries the things we love in life with how we channel those things into goodwill for others.
"Soul has multiple layers: kids will enjoy the animation of the characters, the physical comedy, and the music, while adults will be confronted with issues that, although are intrinsic to our existence, we tend to avoid. [Full review in Spanish]"
Soul is a perfect movie.
"Right when you think you get the message of the film, it turns another corner and you realize it's actually about something else. That makes this really good for rewatches."
"Another example of Pixar's prodigious ability to elevate CG animation to a level of art that is astounding, thoughtful, emotive, and profound."
"It may not be your favorite Pixar, but there's no denying the imagination and lofty vision Pete Docter and Kemp Powers have with this film. And yes, like most Pixar, it very well may make you cry at the end."
"...Easily Pixar's most adult film to date, and one that is likely to make you ponder and even question your own life choices."
"While it deals with grown-up topics such as the meaning of life, it tip-toes around the idea of mortality, choosing instead to put forward a candy-coloured cosmology that often suffocates its deeper questions under layers of whimsy."
For a film like Soul it is more attractive to embellish and simplify the questions than to take a risk with their own answers.
"Soul is nuanced and layered, but it's not perfect. Yet, despite the serious themes, the richness of the narrative and the stunning jazz score make it more than worthwhile."
"""Soul"" may fail to fully follow through on its characters or its premise, but even a duller Pixar film will leave an impression."
It's some of the most striking work that Pixar has ever turned in.
"Soul is about a person who happens to be black, and not a black American film. Have no confusion about that... But the film is really funny."
"The meaning of ""Soul"" also comes through in the pointillist realism of Pixar. As delightful as its imagery of the afterlife is, the best stuff might be back on Earth."
"In the absence of transcendence, Terry tickled me into giggles. That'll do just fine."
"A little disappointment that, despite its formulaic essence, prevails as one of the best titles of 2020."
"Indeed, it's frequently more complicated than it already sounds and yet it moves along so breezily... that its deeper resonances hit you in a way great art often does: unexpectedly and with a force that's sometimes difficult to explain."
"After plunging into the human mind in Inside Out and then the afterlife in Coco, Pixar Animation Studios takes us into both in Soul."
Soul is a beautiful film blending together the best-of-the-best of Pixar magic.
"Amazing animation, serious themes in existential dramedy."
"It's seriously fun. But the problem with explaining the massive questions of life via an eclectic hodgepodge of concepts gleaned from various spiritual and philosophical paths, is that only adults can shake this kind of thing off as mere entertainment."
"I'm not saying that Pixar is telling stories with the thematic complexity of an Ozu or Kubrick. I am saying that Pixar does what Disney does, only with more sophistication and layers."
Glad Pixar once again comes up with a fresh concept. A soulful film both thematically and in terms of the music genre. Pete Docter + team gives another imaginative insight into our humanity in the most delightful way.
"""Soul"" has a lesson, one children can afford to learn, about our purpose in life, about our spark, about our music."
The film is an ode to teachers.
"Delivering one of his finest performances in years, [Jamie Foxx] takes Docter and co-writer-director Kemp Powers'... excellent script and crafts an endearingly flawed character who feels like one of the most human Pixar have brought to life."
"It has a few things that just don't quite click for me, but I forgive them because it really is very emotionally touching."
You can tell this is a movie where they put a lot of thought into what they wanted to take away from the message about souls and about what unites us... I think it is just an absolutely beautiful film.
"It's warm, it's charming, it's funny, [and] it has a terrific jazz score. It's a lovely film and has some very interesting, groundbreaking design work."
Delighting in possibility. It's heavenly screwball.
"Docter does use his brightly colored, metaphysical version of It's a Wonderful Life to a good end. The movie doesn't just avoid the ""pursue your dream at all costs"" message we typically get from kids' entertainment. It positively rebukes it."
"Soul can remind us that being present with those we love, looking around at nature and the everyday turnings of our world is all we need to feel grateful for what we have, rather than focusing on that which we may have lost."
Clever observations and funny lines deliciously intertwine in a eye-grabbing work of art that is both spiritually rich and terrestrially encouraging.
Its visual language is nuanced and lovely - particularly in character design - and its approach to the massive questions it poses is deft and moving.
"Soul is another strong entry into Pixar's filmography, delivering a timely message during a pandemic. Its somewhat predictable story holds it back from my top tier of Pixar films, but with its strong message and memorable score, it's executed beautifully."
"Sweet and sly, Soul is the hopeful note on which we needed to exit 2020. And it'll make a great way to start 2021 if you've yet to watch it."
"Pixar, it's good to have you back."
"Although it is ostensibly about what lies before and after life, Soul is touching because, ultimately, it realizes that what really matters is what we do while it lasts. [Full review in Portuguese]"
"One of the best Pixar flicks in years, but still marred by positioning as yet another black animated movie where the protagonist spends a significant amount of the film's running time as something other than a black human being."
Pixar has made another animated classic with Soul.
"Soul marks a return to form for Pixar, tapping into the finite motifs and imaginative imagery that morphed the studio into a household staple."
"...if a movie makes you want yourself and others to be their best self, how can anyone possibly be opposed to that?"
"Expect a lot of questions because Soul throws out a lot of ideas, concepts and theories. The script ends up being like a jazz composition because of those elements."
"The film's score hums with jazz written and performed by Jonathan Batiste...Indeed, the film's most transcendent moments may well be those set not in the supernatural realm, but in a dark, crowded Manhattan jazz club."
Pixar's Soul is a tear-jerking animated adventure that taps into some weighty themes but proves incredibly touching for the whole family.
"It isn't the cure-all balm for the soul you wish it was at the end of a terrible year. Its tacked-on ending might ring hollow for some. For others, it might just give them the hope to power through their crises."
"With all its wonders and beauty, Soul is a significant step forward in representation, but also takes some steps back."
I'm a fan for a number of reasons...it popped in a really remarkable way...
Soul is yet another winning Pixar venture that hits you in all the right places with how it marries a whimsical animated adventure with humanity and meaning.
"[It] has its moments, but slammed together into one feature, they feel like they're fighting for dominance from one scene to the next, resulting in a film that, for all the work that's clearly gone into it, just doesn't seem to know what it wants to say."
"I love how strange Soul is, while still managing to feel at home in the Pixar universe."
"Both cleverly crafted (especially during the otherworldly sequences, with its Picasso-esque characters) and moving..."
"Music wallpapers every frame of Soul, with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross sure to be nominated for another Oscar for their jazz-infused score."
"There's a lot to love. The animation is dope, and New York is captured in all its urban glory...it will have most adults in tears."
Not many will want to argue with the message and Pixar offers another deluge of creativity.
A charming animated redemption story...
"It's rare that an animated feature from a big franchise leaves both adult and youth audiences pondering their purpose in life. Yet, Pixar and Disney's 'Soul' does this and so much more with humor, sensitivity and grace."
"""Soul"" is a Disney+ feature that again demonstrates that animation can be a powerful way to tell a compelling story that would be difficult for live action."
"Toggling between the two worlds, Soul finds a near extraordinary visual and sonic landscape."
"What this all adds up to is a gorgeous, very enjoyable and somewhat well-intentioned effort... Nevertheless, though it may aspire to the likes of Inside Out or Coco, Soul never quite reaches their heights."
"I feel like an ingrate as I complain about a mainstream Disney release that doesn't talk down to its audience, a Trojan horse of philosophizing packaged as shiny entertainment. But as much as I was intrigued by Soul, I didn't actually enjoy the experience"
"Here's a film that's perfect for the entire family. Similar in tone to Disney's ""Inside Out,"" kids and adults are shown that through our differences, we shine as people and that it's never too late to follow your dreams."
"If it's New Year joy you're after, then Soul should restore your sense of gratitude to overflowing."
"It's a giant leap forward for the Pixar folks: an intelligent meditation on what makes us, us, one predominantly geared at grown-ups."
"The pair's quest features race-against-time-adventure, bustling body-swap comedy and metaphysical flights of imagination."
"It's easy to become blase about the visual brilliance, both technical and artistic, of Pixar's output, but Soul really is a treat for the eyes."
"In its attempt to provide clever answers to unknowable questions, Soul just makes everything more confusing."
Soul adopts many of the elements and ideas that have made Pixar films so beloved over the years.
"""Soul"" is all about who you are, what you wanted to be, fulfilling your life's dream. Don't see it stoned, or your mind will be blown. But it's not a lot of navel gazing or very preachy."
Spectacular music and visually astonishing. I felt it was beautiful that the film presents the idea that we're responsible for ourselves from even before our existence. A wake up call for many of us looking for answers. [Full review in Spanish]
"Qualms aside, Soul is one of the more thought-provoking Pixar releases in years."
"The film, a lush, gorgeous work of animation that deserves to be seen on a large screen (my 65 inches don't cut it) proves to be intelligent, ambitious and reflective."
This is one of Pixar's deepest and most melancholy animated comedies.
"It's a fiercely intelligent approach, funny and warm, knowing and insightful, and the way it expresses what's truly important is simply staggering."
"Soul is certainly a movie that kids of all ages can enjoy for the visuals, loveable characters, and handful of slapstick laughs, but this is easiy Pixar's most mature film to date, as much, if not more, for adults than kids."
"Soul is the perfect escape to find yourself and while it may appeal more to adults than children, the animation will certainly capture the heart and soul, pun intended, of everyone who watches it."
"My favorite part was the earth-bound stuff, which featured one of the most evocative renderings of New York City I've ever seen on film, animated or not."
"Soul looks astonishing throughout, a triumph of technical achievement, but it's not matched by clarity of story. It feels like there are too many cooks -- or to use the film's own metaphor, too many band members playing a different tune."
"""Soul"" is a great time for younger viewers but for adults it touches on that sense of feeling the frustration of our big dreams. This is a rare animated film in how it tackles that subject."
"In a year in which more attention has been paid to Black death than ever before, Soul's adherence to yet another unnecessary Black out-of-body experience becomes even more tonally dissonant than it was before."
"The ambition of Docter's world building is laudable. And the smaller, human narrative he tries to tell within that universe is sweet and charming. But given its vast canvas, Soul sometimes struggles to focus on that more intimate story."
"It's funny, surprising, and powerful, but above all, it feels like Pixar returning to the core values that used to define it as a creative house, and returning to the inspiring industry leader it used to be."
"I can say that when it works, it's amazing stuff."
Soul is highly recommended -- especially to adults who might not be otherwise inclined -- and a return to form for Pixar after the less-satisfying Onward.
"Soul is more abstract than past Pixar movies, but just as entertaining."
"[O]ne of the year's best films...smart and sharp and thought-provoking, all while offering plenty of lighthearted goofiness. It looks great, it sounds great ... it IS great. Soul shines - and sings."
There were so many laugh out loud moments... it was it was just really delightful.
Having films like this for kids and adults is great because it helps us to sort of cope with those difficult concepts.
"Though the supporting cast and the score are worth the price of admission, Soul lands squarely in the middle of the pack when it comes to Pixar's legendary film canon."
"It's the final moments of Soul, however, that make it transcendent."
"Not necessarily a bad film, per se, but it never quite manages to be as great, powerful or thought-provoking as it would clearly like to be."
"One thing Pixar films never fail to do is construct the ""world"" of their stories, and Soul has an ingenious attention to detail. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Soul manages to speak to its broad demographics simultaneously, never letting weighty themes drag down its engaging narrative."
"A Pixar film that tackles mental health, depression and the meaning a life...seriously it does. Watch Soul!"
"It introduces several great concepts, themes and plots, but Soul doesn't give any of them the proper attention to grow."
"Like a perfectly soothing, candlelit bath on an otherwise beastly cold night."
"Soul is a bit more conventional in the end, but the approaches are recognizable and inspiring like in the best Pixar movies. [Full review in Spanish]"
A talented voice [cast]. [Full review in Spanish]
It's another win for Pixar.
"There are stretches in Soul where Docter and his team are very much in the zone, crafting many magical and beguiling moments, only occasionally getting knocked out of it along the way."
"That directors Pete Docter and Kemp Powers have been able to tell a story about human nature, death and music through a family film is worth admiring. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Definitively not one of Pixar's all time greatest, but still colorful and spirited enough to take audiences into an enjoyable and heartfelt trip."
I could not be more excited for families to get to see Soul! It's an emotional and heart-warming story that all levels will be able to appreciate in one way or another.
Soul is sneaky in a way that reminds you never to underestimate Pixar.
"The film recognizes the importance of jazz, and there's a welcome tribute to its history throughout this animated delight."
"Magnificent animation proposal. A film set to become one of Pixar's classics. Thoughtful, intelligent and very funny. [Full review in Spanish]"
Soul meets Pixar's high standards of a visually compelling film that tackles heavy emotional issues in an entertaining way ... Just don't expect ... major representation of African American culture in the way that Pixar's Coco celebrated Mexican culture.
"An emotional cinematic celebration on many levels. When the history of Pixar is told, this will be one of their greatest films ... an instant classic to watch over and over."
The animation and voice cast are outstanding. It has my favorite score of the year. There's not a lot to criticize. Soul is worthy of the Pixar banner.
"In this abstract assortment, everyone from Archimedes to New York's infamous Pizza Rat earns a mention and, somehow, it remains exhilarating. Go figure."
"Soul is ... for sure one of the best animated films of the year, but ... it lacks a certain whimsy to appeal to children."
"Regular, old living is where it's at."
"Unbelievably nice and sweet, to such a degree that it begins to lose some definition."
"There are so many lessons to learn from SOUL including a solid appreciation for pizza. I adore SOUL, because it causes kids to ask hard questions in an age-appropriate way."
"A spiritual cousin (of sorts) to Inside Out, Soul is another example of Pixar at its best. It's ambitious and inspiring filmmaking about life [Full review in Spanish]"
"There's richness all around, as it makes the intangible tangible. An important year-end flick for 2020."
"Frustrating sentimentality keeps the astral weirdness from the sublime, but it's a swing in the right high-concept direction."
"""Soul"" ... confirms director Pete Docter as perhaps the greatest surrealist filmmaker since the Japanese legend Hayao Miyazaki."
A lot of Pixar films provide adults a whimsical look at life they've already experienced. Soul suggests the future is still ahead for those willing to embrace it.
It's upper-middle-tier Pixar.
"There's so much joy, love, inspiration, truth, and wisdom within Soul. It shines light on the meaning of life that can be interpreted in many ways which is why the film is so beautiful."
"Soul stuffs its playful optimism into a simple message and delivers it with colorful, endearing beauty."
"Conceptually simple, it carries a profound complexity beneath the surface, depicting an existential crisis that becomes a life-affirming examination of ambition, regret, obsession, insecurity, fear, and joy."
"Clearly the best animated film of 2020. (Full Content Review for Parents - Scary Scenes, etc. - also Available)"
"Like other great New York movies, it invites you to identify particular intersections and storefronts, to compare its imagined geography with the city of your own experience."
"Ultimately, the message of Soul is what sticks out the most about it, as it's uniquely refreshing to see questions like these aimed toward children, while still leaving enough room for productive conversation and, fittingly, introspection."
"""Soul"" is a return to Pixar's roots of storytelling above all, but it also leaves me a bit melancholy."
"Amazingly animated, perfectly voice-cast, and managing to surprise without losing focus, the more one thinks about Soul, the better it becomes."
'Soul' is the warm chicken soup and philosophical hug that we need right now.
The plot of this film is ridiculous.
"'Soul' offers an adventure that seamlessly balances insight with understanding. It's bright, beautiful, and emotionally affecting."
"A great cascade of entertainment, full of captivating ideas and brilliantly conceived supernatural visuals...the images director Pete Docter & his crew have conjured of these celestial netherworlds are at once compelling, beautiful and delightful."
"The film, like Docter's previous ones, is a great accomplishment of imagination, filled with real ideas, inventive design, and grounded by an emotional core..."
"This film may contain the heftiest life lesson in a Disney/Pixar film that targets adults more than children. Even though this doesn't rank among the best of the studios' work, this still meets Pixar's high standards for storytelling."
"Like the best jazz players, from Miles Davis to Kris Davis, Docter uses a traditional framework to branch off into new and exciting directions, without losing sight of the main theme."
"Soul represents another milestone for Pixar as it successfully mixes beautiful animation, inspiring music, and strong voice acting to create a uniquely brilliant experience."
"It's a wonderful life for Joe Gardner and whose love for jazz is animated for posterity through the words of Kemp Power and music of Jon Baptiste, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross"
"The film juggles interesting ideas, dramatizing them with great verve and deep feeling."
It's a meditation on death that turns into a celebration of living.
"Docter and Powers do a remarkable job of making things flow in the best Pixar vein. It's very funny, of course, but the most memorable moments are existential, when characters experience small revelations, begin to see what life is about."
"'Soul' focuses on dealing with the struggles of life and rising to the occasion, even if it means subverting your own goal to help someone else reach his or hers."
"It is both raucous and Zen as it tells the story of a jazz musician who is not ready for the Great Beyond, thereby becoming a perfect koan, and possibly the best movie of the decade."
"Another major achievement from Pixar, and obvious contender for best animated feature awards."
"A movie bursting to the seams with wild concepts, twists, and turns, almost to the point of feeling overloaded with them."
"A metaphysical dramedy set against an often trippy, post-Sergeant Pepper vision of life before life and life after death, Soul is an imaginatively rendered mid-life crisis."
"There's a beautiful sentiment that delivers a reminder to live life the fullest now, before it's too late. It's a message that stings even harder in the era of pandemic lockdowns."
Soul is about the things that make life worth living.
I'll be watching that one again and again.
Soul has some pretty interesting things to say about the fine line between being passionate and being consumed by it. And how society tends to conflate passion with purpose
A moving think piece that will stick with you long after the credits roll.
An instructive fable infused with Pixar's on-brand pop philosophy. (You just know it's going to take you to a place that's 'moving').
"A really good Pixar animated film but not as good as I expected. A little less tine with the ""blobs"" would have sufficed."
"It is the perfect film at the perfect time and for that, it can get no better."
"To anyone of a certain age who has ever wrestled with similar fears and disappointments, Soul is sure to resonate, even if parts of it don't work as well as others."
"Making life seem beautiful no matter the challenge is part of what I got from Pixar's Soul. And after I wiped the tears and quietly contemplated the film's message, I felt a little better about the world in general."
"Pixar has brought us another gorgeously animated, poignant story that transcends what most animated features do."
"There are many elaborate lessons on life and how to live it in Soul, though its best may ironically be its simplest: Look. Listen. Learn. Enjoy."
"A gorgeously animated, lovingly performed examination of the human condition."
"""Soul"" challenges us to consider its heartfelt themes. We're reminded that the process of self-discovery always provides a solid foundation for great story-telling."
The heavenly 'Soul' hits all the right notes.
"There are times when watching this animated masterpiece feels like being gently indoctrinated into a new religion, one whose creed radiates tranquility, warmth and joy."
Beautifully animated. Some truly galaxy-brain New York jokes. But the ending is thematically troublesome in a way that betrays Pete Docter's usual confidence in his ideas. It's the first time we've seen his concept and execution get a bit crossed up.
"Soul finds the company doing the minor-chord uplift it does so well, even an inch short of top form."
This movie felt a little more mature to me in terms of the concept and the way the animation was done... It was really cool to see Pixar take a chance on something like this.
"'Soul' is one of Pixar's best movies, but it's also the first targeted more towards adults than children."
"A Pete Docter film is strong enough in its own right to be placed in the higher tier of recent Pixar efforts, and while it may stumble from time to time, there's no denying that its heart is in the right place."
Soul is going to be living inside me for a long time.
"This is the movie of the year for me. amazing voice performances, animation, score. I loved this movie!"
I kind of wished this movie came out earlier...because I think people could have gotten something out of this. Super powerful movie. They had a killer screenplay.
"Soul ends on the perfect note, its last moments overflowing in voluminous human insights so melodious I could happily hum its climactic tune for a lifetime and likely never grow tired of hearing it."
"Soul is perhaps the best film to come from the world of Pixar as director/co-writer Pete Docter manages to best his earlier film, Inside Out."
I'll be damned if I don't appreciate it for honouring pizza with the screen time and the respect that it deserves.
"Play it again, ""Soul."""
"Soul is an inspirational, laugh out loud funny, and purely joyous piece of entertainment for all ages that spans beyond our existential plane. As an animated film, it's beautifully animated, even by Pixar's high standards."
There's as much to laugh about here as there is to take in the implications and complexities of what the beforelife and afterlife seem to be.
Soul feels easily like one of the best Pixar movies in years...
"It's a minor flick, to be sure, but the band is tight tonight and there's some pleasure in that if you give yourself over to it. It doesn't have fire, I'd say, but it's got a spark."
"Kids might be lulled by its dulcet presentation, but despite its big ideas, ""Soul"" is ambitious but flawed, a high concept high beam act that is a little too wobbly for its own good."
"There's a lot of poignancy to Soul without being bogged down in sentimentality. It's a cure for any existential malaise 2020 may have burdened on us, a celebration of the mundane and the grand, all-consuming passions."
A figuratively astral journey full of imaginative moments that make us laugh as well as reflect on our position in life and the universe itself[ Full review in Spanish]
"Filled with the right amount of humour and heart, Soul makes one feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside."
"What makes life meaningful? We are human because we ask this question, and the answer in part is to make movies like this one, to explore what makes life worthwhile."
"The film's post-modern evocation of the afterlife, set to a nearly transcendent score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross and the wistful jazz stylings of Jon Batiste, is unlike anything Pixar has done before."
"Like the finest Pixar pictures, 'Soul' engages both the brain and the heart, and does so in a visually entrancing fashion."
"""Soul"" is messy, maudlin, funny, ridiculous, and poignant. In other words, it has soul."
"Passing the love of jazz on to a younger generation, cloaked in the sweetness of an animated movie, is a genius move."
"Like an ethereal cousin to his triumphant ""Inside Out,"" ""Soul"" is another playful exercise in metaphysical world building, a door-slamming farce staged between the portals of consciousness."
The vocal talents of this cast are that of seasoned professionals and they all bring their unique styles to the characters they portray.
"Be ready for hard swallows, brow rubs, and exasperating ""well..."" sentence starters that follow the life-and-death questions being played with freely."
"The sharpest Pixar screenplay in years, with a screwball vibe and consistently witty use of cutaway gags. So much of it works at such a high level. What keeps it from achieving greatness?"
"Soul feels like a defiant anomaly, an actual risk that demands to be taken seriously. It may not be perfect, but it suggests a creative future for Pixar that hopefully heralds more fascinating results."
"Soul aims to provide a feel-good balm on what it means to be alive and to cherish every moment. And there is indeed a sublime beauty, thoughtfulness and tenderness to Joe's journey towards self-fulfilment and all that jazz."
"Much like Docter's previous Pixar films, the magic of Soul is not its sophistication; it's that the movie tackles complicated, adult themes in a way a child can at least relate to, if not fully understand."
SOUL is a good Pixar film about not letting your life pass you by. It gets a bit lost in the middle but figures itself out by the end. .
The film is one of Disney/Pixar's best efforts in years. It's full of sublime attributes that eclipse many life-actioners this year.
Pixar's latest is a jazz composition that finds purpose in the quiet moments.
"""Soul"" is a frustrating combination of artistry, charm and a Pixar formula that is starting to feel tuckered out."
"The beauty of ""Soul"" is that, just as animation is finding more being demanded of it, Pixar is answering that demand."
"Soul combines the abstract and the irreverent. As such, it also makes some unusual choices, some of which may stray from its most salient potential."
"A far more meaningful film now given the climate of the world at hand, Soul is a deeply-felt, oft-hilarious, more experimental effort from Pixar that serves as a lovely ode to both life and death."
"Soul is an emotional story exploring the meaning of life, taking you on a magical journey with its stunning visuals, beautiful message, and delightful cast."
"It's a remarkable story, perhaps geared more toward adults than children, that sends a perfect message of living our best lives each and every day."
It's a profound lesson that the best parts of life are what happens when you're not really paying attention.
"There's a definite satisfaction to how expectation-defying the film is, with its hairpin twists and turns, though some of the surprises stem from the way that Soul can't entirely figure out how its two worlds mesh together thematically."
"It's probably fitting that, in a film that urges us to embrace the everyday miracles of life, I found myself preferring the real world of ""Soul"" over its fantastic one."
"Pete Docter's joyous ""Soul"" is a return to top-tier Pixar that tackles tough subjects while transcending age barriers. The best animated film of 2020."
Soul begins at full throttle... with visual discoveries. [Full review in Spanish]
"Soul will doubtless keep its audience occupied for 100 minutes over this locked-down Christmas, but whether it'll win repeat viewers is another question."
"A great soundtrack, plenty of heart, and a stunning depiction of a life built on music, make Soul a journey that is worth undertaking."
"Far from teaching children to follow their dreams, the movie... advocates leaving the dreaming to the pros."
A bold and ambitious film about the perspective of life that made me feel seen not only as a Black person but also as a New Yorker and most importantly a human being.
"Pixar's signature mature approach to resonant storytelling and visual wizardry is consistently on display here, as is their dedication to pushing the boundaries of originality."
"What truly deepens the film is the unexpected pivotit takes away from the ""follow-your-dreams"" message of a thousand Hollywood features into the less charted territory that lies beyond."
"Soul is yet another homerun not just for director Pete Docter, who is almost scary good at this point, but also one of Pixar's best."
"Like the best Pixar films, ""Soul"" isn't just for kids. There are lessons here for all ages, some surprisingly complex."
"Pure genius and an absolute masterwork. A true, transcendental and euphoric experience for the eyes, ears and... yes... soul. A deep dive into the human psyche in the most meaningful way possible. It's one of Pixar's best of ALL TIME."
"This is a film in two parts and while the earthbound, jazz fueled pieces soar, the Great Before is another in a series of candy-colored representation of those intangible things which make us human..."
"Arrives at some numbingly complex - and maybe not entirely consistent - answers, but generates some fun, and genuine beauty, along the way."
"It is an astonishingly beautiful film, one that plays with abstract, cartoonish animation forms in its scenes set in the Great Beyond and Great Before while also providing some of the best photorealistic digital animation."
"Pixar's first feature with a predominantly Black cast and a Black lead actor (the superb Jamie Foxx) contemplates the origins of jazz and the meaning of life and death. Don't fret the metaphysics, kids, It's the year's peak achievement in animation."
"If the climax feels like a bit of a cop-out and the story is too complicated for younger children, Soul packs a real emotional wallop and it's unbelievably easy to get lost in the sheer wonder of it all."
"Soul Is a Nearly Perfect, Beautiful, and Heartwarming Film."
"Featuring an outstanding voice cast, Soul deals with challenging concepts, yet they are presented to us in such a beautifully simple way."
Soul is marvellous on many fronts.
"[Soul is] pleasant and clever, with a generous heart, committed voice acting, and some of the kookiest images in Pixar history."
"The latest tour de force from Pixar, Soul is a bold, conceptual jaunt across the astral plane."
"Despite some distraction and not quite enough music, Soul manages to tap into deep emotion as its characters explore the limits of mortality and what it means to be passionate about life."
"Inspirational and moving enough that like the best Pixar movies, it will get you feeling quite teary but also happy to be alive."
"That it's willing to ask such big questions of its characters (and in turn, the audience), and upend the tried-and-tested narrative structure counts for a lot."
Soul is a visual delight that strengthens the importance of the little things. (...) The perfect catharsis for the year we've had. [Full review in Spanish]
"The pitfalls of Soul are less reflective of the actual story than they are of the reality that 25 years into releasing feature films, Pixar has become - dare it be said - a mite formulaic."
