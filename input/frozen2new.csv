review
"Frozen II compensates for the six-year wait with a follow-up worthy of standing up to its original, which in my opinion, surpasses it. It really feels like a magical film."
"We also get amazing songs like Into The Unknown, Some Things Never Change, Show Yourself and of course Lost in the Woods. They're easily on par with Let It Go, Do You Want to Build a Snowman and For the First Time in Forever."
"Frozen II has affable intentions, but overall it fails to meet the expectations set by its predecessor, and it lacked real substance."
"Just when you think Frozen II shows signs of doing something bold or confronting, it pulls back to a commercial safe zone, supplying Disney with an excuse to further their empire with future sequels and a reliable franchise."
"Reminded me of an old adage that women have larger colour vocabularies and a greater sensibility for colour than (most) men, and that feeling certainly transmits here."
So well done... it was just a beautiful experience.
The plot of the sequel is both convoluted and familiar.
"While its music, visual effects, and general spectacle will wow audiences, it's nice to know that Disney is still maintaining the responsibility of exploring change in their stories through diverse ways."
"You will probably either laugh or cringe. I laughed out loud. And, yes, Olaf (Josh Gad) gets plenty of opportunities to entertain us, including a song that hilariously recaps what happened in the first film."
"The film's answers and resolutions may end up feeling too vague or abstract, but this bold and sensory approach to storytelling is something that I hope to see more of from Disney."
"Like most sequels, Frozen II doesn't quite live up to the first film, but it's far from a waste of time. If nothing else, it's nice to be able to spend some more time with the engaging characters of Arendelle."
"The beauty of this sequel is that it is more intricate than the first, namely in plot. It ditches the simplicity of what boiled down to repairing a sister-sister relationship and opts instead for lofty, complicated concepts in a children's movie."
"While it's usually difficult to surpass the original, this broader, more engaging follow up to the wildly successful original speaks more to the power of togetherness than its predecessor even considered."
Pleasant and enjoyable but unlikely to leave much of a mark.
"Disney's 'Frozen 2' far exceeds the original animated film. The character development, storyline and the overall themes are more nuanced, detailed and intriguing. There are some scenes that may insight fear in smaller kids, but overall it's kid-friendly."
Frozen 2 brings the strenghts of the first movie and takes them further (...). It's more balanced so kids and adults can enjoy the journey. [Full review in Spanish]
"There's no question the Littles will enjoy Frozen 2. It's plenty colorful, even if it did feel long. I say ""feel long"" because it's only 103 minutes, but a lot is going on."
Disney has managed an impressive act of tightrope walking in following up their latest golden goose with something that shimmers almost as brightly
It's a sweet tale of sisters doing it for themselves with a melancholic hinting at how childhood's innocence gives way to the concerns of the world and their place in it.
A beautiful and very entertaining animated sequel that makes me have a nice time for a magical hour and a half. [Full review in Spanish]
"Frozen II may sing about change, but that progress is what you project onto it."
"""Frozen II"" is sure to please the kiddies and their parents with catchy tunes and wondrous animation, even if it makes the plot more complicated than it needs to be for its target audience."
"Frozen 2 may not warm the cockles of your heart quite to the extent that Frozen did, but it will, if you sit back and let it sweep over you, take your breath away."
"They try to throw a lot at you, but very little is focused."
"There's a whole lot of charm in this, but it follows the original's winning formula a little too closely that it feels almost repetitive."
"Although the sequel is no match with the 2013 original, ""Frozen II"" remains a decent sequel that - at least, thankfully - doesn't feel like a blatant cash grab after all."
"Frozen II is a solid follow up to a brilliant film, managing to surpass the original in a lot of ways, while also being weaker in many other ways."
"A visually marvellous work, with stunning imagery and design."
A distressingly unnecessary (and fairly tedious) sequel...
Frozen II is the exact kind of sequel that more film series need: it takes chances (within the framework of a Disney animated feature)...
[A]n ultimately satisfying story of more mature themes for an audience that's grown out of the dress-up stage.
should be applauded for taking its own route while maintaining much of what made the original so enjoyable and memorable
"I sincerely appreciated the respect paid toward the Northuldra. The fictional Indigenous tribe based on Sámi culture. A fun and magical film, but way too many songs."
"It makes the world of Frozen feel infinite, even if the characters and the story make it feel like it's a small world after all. Perhaps I should just let it go."
"With no surprises, without looking for its female characters stand out, Frozen 2 disappoints, and misrepresents the magical sense that the first installment had. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Will please fans of Anna, Elsa and her friends. [Full review in Spanish]"
The whole movie is esthetically beautiful. [Full Review in Spanish]
Frozen II is a notch below its predecessor but still has a lot to offer.
"The story works well enough and there is enough humor in it to go along with the more serious elements. The animation, by Walt Disney Animation studios, is beautiful."
Arguably the true stars of Frozen were the Lopez husband-and-wife songwriting team.
"Fans will warm up to ""Frozen II."""
They still have the amazing ability to play the right keys to reach the heart of the audience. [Full review in Spanish]
[The] vocals are beautifully done.
The result is just a discombobulated mess.
... an early holiday present to princesses' everywhere.
"Frozen 2 is easily the most-anticipated animated Disney sequel ever, and it does not disappoint."
"FROZEN 2 is an equal, if not better film than its predecessor."
"Frozen II may not deliver the same love and energy of the first film, but with extraordinary animation, positive messages, and our beloved Olaf, it's still a film for Frozen fans to see."
A waste of beautiful animation.
The storyline overall feels forced and clunky.
"The songs, perhaps not as compelling as in the original, still make the heart beat faster now and then."
"It's all still very fantastical and while it likely falls slightly short of the first picture, it's still a wonderfully enjoyable movie."
...a torturously convoluted extension of an already complicated narrative.
"Frozen II still feels like the market-demanded sequel we know it to be. However, it's worth noting that despite the parts of it that were more than likely the result of studio notes, there's still an emotional core worth appreciating."
"So Frozen 2's attempts to evolve may not be entirely successful. So Frozen 2 seems like it's doing too much. There's something endearing about watching it try, and stumble, and try again."
Frozen II is the heroine's journey Elsa deserved from the start.
"Frozen 2... is more mature, ambitious, and intricate than its predecessor."
Fans of Frozen may have had to wait six years for the return of their beloved Elsa and Anna but the wait proves worth it with this dark but empowering sequel.
"The whole is far from perfect, but the good does outweigh the bad like its predecessor. [And] human compassion reigns supreme."
"A bit lesser than the previous film and, perhaps blessedly for all the parents out there, the songs are not quite as catchy, but Frozen 2 does world building quite well and earns high marks for charm."
Frozen II settles with simply continuing its story. [Full Review in Spanish]
A pleasant family entertainment that doesn't reach the high notes of its predecessor. The spectacle and most of the humor compensates for a story that feels too convoluted and simplistic at the same time. [Full review in Spanish]
"The excess in singing in this film is a bit fastidious, but it does give the film a feel more akin to literature than something cinematic. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"There's magic here, and elemental spirits, but no magic and nothing elemental, metaphorically speaking. Rote and smaller than its predecessor. Even the songs are bland and forgettable."
"Disney works its magic again with a sequel that outperforms the original. The actors, the animation, and especially the songs - it is all amazing. I'm just waiting to hear 4 year olds break into ""Into the Unknown""!!!!!"
"Frozen II has some charming moments and the returning vocal cast are in pleasing form, but there's something unwise in separating the characters so much."
A gorgeous film.
"Beautifully realised, with a terrific soundtrack (yes, better than last time)."
"This first viewing looks gorgeous and Olaf is my hero, but the story lacked the magic of its predecessor..."
"I'm glad to report that, while it doesn't quite reach the heights of the first tale, Frozen 2 is a fabulous follow-up that both children and their caregivers should warmly embrace."
"Overall 'Frozen 2' was decent, but a little clunky in places. While the soundtrack wasn't as memorable as the first one, the animation is incredible, and Disney just keep improving in that aspect."
"The plotting of Frozen 2 is arguably too busy (and a mite too dark) for its own good, with a lot of chatter about death, mortality, tribal prejudices, and even alternate dimensions piled on for no discernible, franchise-expanding reason."
"Frozen II handles its business, crafting another solid chapter in the franchise."
Disney's hottest 'toon is back for a sequel that is not quite as magical as the first but still blissfully musical.
"As someone who didn't love the first film, I was nervous going into Frozen 2. Thankfully, this works as a better musical than the first, which makes it a better film."
A sequel that's entertaining but doesn't capture the clear purpose and power of the original.
"Frozen II often doesn't feel like a movie as much as a chess match, with the characters being shoved all around the board with studied precision."
"Going in, expecting a finely-tuned toy advertisement, and instead getting bonkers nonsense with some fine songs and Elsa ice-surfing, is unpredictable, and unpredictable in this case is to be celebrated."
"Enough about it works to give fans a reasonable degree of entertainment. Still, there's no denying that it's a big step down from the original."
"Frozen II isn't the achievement that its predecessor was, it's still pretty darned good. Better than it had to be, really...this new installment will likely prove just as beloved as the first."
"It gives us more of Elsa, Anna, Olaf, and the rest of the ""Frozen"" favs. But beyond nostalgia, it's ultimately a series of pretty portraits hung around a rather rudderless story."
Dazzling animation as the sisters' story - and this lucrative franchise - continues...
"Even better than the first Frozen, Frozen 2 is the best animated feature of the year and an impressive follow-up."
"It eventually lands on something that works pretty well... The first half, though, feels like the movie has to restart very nearly every single time it changes locations."
"While not quite hitting the emotional peaks of Frozen, Frozen II comes close enough...In all, they've done a splendid job replicating the atmosphere and joy of the first film while developing the lore around its cast of beloved characters."
Frozen 2 doesn't quite recapture the magic of its predecessor but it's a perfectly serviceable follow-up.
"Yes, the characters are still charming, and yes, the animation is stunning. But you know there's a problem when the movie includes three different sequences that either just describe favorite moments from the previous movie or straight-up re-runs them."
"It more than lives up to its predecessor's reputation, with an ambitious and emotional story at its icy (in a good way) heart; and 90 minutes of rollicking Disney adventure."
"Throughout it's entirety, in fact, the plot is such that you can see the grouting, you can see the screenwriting glue between the much-mulled-over ideas."
"The visual textures of the Frozen world remain sumptuous, from the jewel-toned forest to the foamy ocean waves that Elsa confronts in a breathtaking sequence."
"Frozen II is a worthy follow-up with enough heart, action, and music to entertain younger and older viewers alike."
"Not a make-cash sequel but a glorious ""Part 2"" of full story of the two sisters beloved since '13 by devoted fans of all ages, places, and genders. None will be disappointed."
May not take you into the unknown ... but it's a worthy-enough sequel that will ironically play strongest to older kids and adults who are spiritually equipped to handle its developing themes.
"Anna ends up singing ""hello darkness, I'm ready to succumb"" and ""this grief has a gravity, it pulls me down."" Like much of the rest of the film, it's a bummer."
"While it's interesting to see a Disney sequel borrow parts of its plot from The Fifth Element, of all things, Frozen II ultimately doesn't go anywhere we don't expect it to. Let's hope that the inevitable Part III is willing to take a few more risks."
"There's so much affection for and investment in the original characters...people will be excited...but I just didn't get the magic. It's fine, but Frozen I was so much more than fine..."
"[Some] sequences have a gleam and a rhythm to them that encapsulates Disney animation at its purest and most sinuous. The film itself doesn't hit that sweet spot that makes Pixar animations, for example, fun for adults as well as their children."
This movie is so confusing that even talking about it is confusing.
"This is a well-considered, beautifully made - if not particularly brave or adventurous - sequel which carries both emotional heft and an intriguing mystery at its heart."
Frozen II is an ambitious and challenging animated film that tries to evolve not only its own story but also the expectations for all of Disney animation.
'Frozen 2' is one more Disney film this year that has taken on some huge social topics and masked them in a story that rivets audiences.
"Your kids will love it. But if you're like me and you love the original for its depth and how well thought out its thematic strengths were, you will find this one sorely lacking."
"The songs in Frozen 2 are memorable, welcoming and fresh and its fun to see the Arendelle gang all back together."
"An enjoyable film, though Elsa's lack of romantic plotline would be more admirable if all of her songs didn't make her sound like she was trying to come out of the closet."
"Even those who don't will be swept up in the propulsive narrative, the sumptuous beauty and the delight of characters who love each other no matter what."
"But it's the relationship between Elsa and Anna that gets the main focus, as it should, offering the sisters another chance to forge their own paths."
"Frozen II is infinitely less transcendent and it is also solemn, leaden and of a feathery magic. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"So, not a disaster, but certainly not great either."
"The original was always going to be a hard act to follow, and although it doesn't quite reach the heights, this sequel should give fans, old and new, a lot of joy."
"With its message of female empowerment, and soundtrack full of earworms - once again written by the award-winning couple Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez - Frozen 2 sticks to its predecessor's winning formula."
"Frozen 2 just lets us know what is missing and, for a film that puts a lot of weight behind the idea of its characters moving on, this one clearly knows it is not yet ready to."
"Ultimately, Frozen II feels like a strong continuation of the popular Disney franchise. The movie reunites some of the best parts of the first film and still manages to develop and improve on the already highly tuned stylistic imagery."
Too bad Frozen 2 doesn't so much chart a new path as echo the one previously laid out.
"It's one thing watching the final credits roll to see the names of the voice cast, but by the time they detail all the people who worked on the film's 'Data and Pipeline Infrastructure', you'll be more than ready for the exit."
"Not only is the imagery even more impressive, but the story is hugely ambitious, allowing characters to deepen in some intriguing ways."
"A complete stunner, worth seeing on the big screen."
"Frozen II is not only visually stunning, funny and moving, it touches something primal and beautiful that few works of art can."
"Frozen 2 had some mighty big snow boots to fill, and it mostly manages it with bags of style, charm and positive messages."
"Frozen 2 lives up to its predecessor; in fact, it may even be better than the original movie."
"Tackles real world issues in a way that's both entertaining to children and palatable to adults. In short, Frozen II is Disney's best film of 2019."
Fun and entertaining to watch.
"Directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck take Elsa and Anna back to the big screen with Frozen II, a bigger, sometimes better sequel to the 2013 blockbuster - one that became the highest grossing animated film of all time in worldwide box office."
Imagine Frozen 2 without Olaf: Is that a movie you'd want to see?
"Funny, entertaining and doubling down on magic, Frozen 2 is a solid sequel that's maybe even slightly better than the original. [Full review in Spanish]"
"If you're expecting this sequel to be on the same level you need to let it go, let it gooooo!"
Frozen II is mediocre and unimaginative cinema. [Full Review in Spanish]
Frozen II is a sequel that dignifies and manages to equal or even surpass its predecessor. [Full Review in Spanish]
Frozen 2 is visually gorgeous but mostly a narrative retread of the original.
"While 'Frozen II' may not quite reach the grand heights of its predecessor, it's still a sequel that demands repeat viewings, and that's not something one often hears these days."
"While the cynical adult in me inwardly groaned at the prospect of seeing this film, my inner child was singing along with the colourful characters and, sometimes, it's nice to let go and give in to that naive joy."
"A friendly troll remarks to Anna and Elsa: ""it's never a dull moment with you two."" He's right."
"While making bold in-story choices continuing to break Disney conventions... leans heavily on visual spectacle and characterization, a safely world-expanding part two in set-up for the inevitable part 3."
"By no means will it reach the status Frozen had in 2013, but for those who want to play in this world again and revisit these well-drawn characters, it could have been much worse."
"Although Frozen 2 is enjoyable enough to watch, it lacks the catchiness of its predecessor so it is sure to both appease and frustrate fans."
"The more times I listen to Frozen II's rousing anthem Into the Unknown, the more I'm convinced of its earworm quality."
"The film has all the heteronormative family values parents rely upon to do their parenting for them, in a handsome package that also reminds kids to look after their siblings and pets."
"It manages to capture again the magic and charm of its predecessor, while offering us a more mature story about the hardships of growing up. Visually striking and tremendously enjoyable. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Frozen II would have benefited from travelling into the unknown a little more but it's still another big win for Disney Animation and features plenty of great songs every bit as catchy as ""Let it Go."""
Too much tuneless music & too little fun. My 6 & 4-year old granddaughters loved it. Other kids in the audience spent much of the movie squirming & wanting to leave. So did I.
"Walking out of the sequel's screening last week, the 8-year-old told the man in charge that she just had seen 'the greatest movie ever.' Meanwhile, the somewhat more discerning 5-year-old waited until she got home to agree with big sis."
"Even the dazzling animation can't make up for what's lacking, including the absence of an instant hit song, dry voice performances, and a mediocre story."
Disney reunites all the elements that made the 2013 original a classic. Here's why it falls short of repeating that feat.
I think it's a dreadful movie. A complete and total betrayal of the first film.
"As far as the story -- it did not move the franchise forward at all. In fact, it seemed to have a terrible case of sequel-itis."
"This is certainly the most beautifully animated film of the year... Unfortunately, the characters and the story get in front of those designs and effects. It's just not what it could have been."
"Another successful sequel for Disney, even if it doesn't quite surpass the first film."
"...one of the most beautifully animated films of the decade, filled with stunning visual pyrotechnics and incredible attention to detail."
"All-in-all, this feel-good film has some spectacular visuals, an environmental message, a couple of good songs and a family-oriented storyline -- what more can one ask for, really?"
"​It's a tall order to expect this sequel to capture the lightning-in-a-bottle magic of the original, but Frozen 2's stunning eye-candy and humour will be enjoyable enough for its younger core audience."
"Way generic and predictable, and sadly so. They had so much to work with..."
"Disappointing? Yes...but not terrible enough to be angry at the film or take it away from the kids that will like it...the artwork was there, there were some efforts put into the rest of the film..."
"The animation looks great, but Disney's unnecessary continuation of the story is merely a blatant brand extension..."
"Though it may be a slightly diminishing return, it's everything kids, and those who were kids back in 2013, want in a sequel."
"Although some of the rainbow flavour appears forced, Frozen II is at its most persuasive when it sticks with Elsa's strange and unpredictable journey. Here is a sequel that didn't quite need to exist, but has enough evocative moments to justify [it]..."
"While ""Frozen II"" might not reach the bar set by the original flick, it's still good enough. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Scary Scenes, etc. - also Available)"
"By the end, audiences perhaps won't share the characters' sense of wonder and discovery. They might be ready to let it go."
"Stunningly beautiful with beloved characters, snappy tunes and grand adventure."
"Destined to make bucket loads of money, Frozen II is a faithful and respectful sequel that will delight audiences everywhere. Prepare to catch Frozen fever once more."
"Frozen 2 has amazing animation and great new songs, but also a muddied message and some continuity issues."
"Because the first movie generated such a bracing gust of enthusiasm, Frozen 2 will inevitably be nitpicked and judged against those lofty standards. Still, there's plenty to enjoy for those willing to chill out, and yes, let the past go."
I hesitate to say which film is better because they are different in story and tone. You're definitely going to laugh. Your kids are going to laugh. You'll walk away humming a song or two.
"It's what you expect from the characters and world, and it gets the job done. But the most enthusiasm one can muster for ""Frozen II"" is it's perfectly adequate, unlikely to create a seismic cultural shift like its predecessor."
Not much gain against a good deal of loss.
"Once again, stand out songs, seven new ones, and musical numbers enliven the journey."
"Anna and Elsa are back with new songs and new adventures into the unknown. Not as strong as the original, but who cares. We can all use a little love, light and holiday magic. Thanks Disney!"
"As far as family-friendly movies go, Frozen 2 serves its purpose, but you can do better."
"An entertaining and visually impactful sequel, ""Frozen II"" has some memorable songs, but ends up struggling narratively."
"Whatever anyone anticipated from Frozen II: Ice, Ice Baby, it probably wasn't a moral about reparations that warns children that their white grandpa is probably super-duper racist."
"Frozen II definitely doesn't surpass the original, but it's a great return for these characters. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The movie's Achilles' heel is that it's geared more toward adults than children, or it's based on an idea of magic that has more to do with the nostalgia of someone in their 30s than with childish curiosity. [Full Review in Spanish]"
In Frozen II climate justice moves from allegorical substrate to the centre of the story.
"Shorter on the character, charm and heart that marked out Frozen, the sequel can't give its high drama the same emotional intensity."
"The new story, which tries to build on Elsa's mythos, is convoluted and feels more invented than organic, leaving ""Frozen 2"" feeling like more of an obligation than an equal to the original film."
Frozen 2 isn't perfect but it's pretty damn close with a solid story and great visuals and songs.
"Frozen II has several delightful moments, but it seems unlikely that it will stay put in viewers' minds quite like the first installment did."
"At a little more than 90 minutes long, the movie is short but packs a lot in terms of a main story and sub-plots."
"For me, the best part of Frozen II involved fanciful animated sequences. The movie also hits the now-requisite female empowerment themes. I thought the original had a little more kick, but as franchise sequels go, audiences could do worse."
"The characters are sprightly, the songs tailor-made for the Broadway show they'll someday inhabit."
"Frozen II boasts a convoluted story with a few plot holes, but returning co-writers and directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee deserve credit for crafting a sequel that seeks to answer the most compelling questions left by Frozen."
Children will take what they what they will out of the message. What they likely won't be is bored. Frozen 2 makes up in pace and on-the-fly distractions what it no longer has in the depth of its story.
"Visually stunning and full of catchy new songs, Frozen II is a worthy addition to the Disney library."
"Frozen 2is forced to contrive new conflicts for royal sisters Anna and Elsa and the kingdom of Arundel. The resulting narrative is dizzying in its complexity. I'm sure it will be popular, I just wish I'd liked it more."
"[This] is a strong, richly rewarding sequel that deftly builds on the themes introduced in the first film and brought to thrilling conclusion here."
"A smartly-turned piece of family entertainment. It is also redundant, somehow even more than most sequels."
"A cloying, forgettable follow-up to a far better movie."
"Directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee were sincere in trying to make ""Frozen II"" as memorable as ""Frozen."" The movie, however, feels rushed and lacking in dynamism."
"The whole thing left me cold, partly because there's no actual villain and thus very little concrete drama."
"It would be understandable if Disney played it safe here, but they didn't. In fact, they pull a couple of stunts that will live forever."
"Frozen 2 might not win everyone over with its use of somber tones and darker imagery, but there's something to be said about a kid's film that shows how positive change and acceptance of oneself is something to never ignore."
"If they're lacking in true firepower, the same goes for ""Frozen II"": it never reaches the heights of its predecessor, but it's an adequate romp in the snow."
"If Frozen II doesn't look to be the cultural behemoth that the first movie was, it shows that there are still things worth finding beneath the ice."
"The ultimate lesson of Frozen II, perhaps, is that some films exist as one-of-a-kind phenomena."
"Frozen II holds on to its artistic vision carefully, honoring its characters and its world while fumbling its way toward their next destination."
"A few new characters, a new dress, and a reindeer sing-a-long aren't worth a 103 minute strained serenade of monotonous fluff."
Gorgeous animation and likable sidekick characters can't save this follow-up effort from coming in a distant second to the original.
"While that means Frozen 2 feels a tad unsatisfying immediately after you've watched it, in the long run, these complexities might be for the positive."
"While Frozen II is accomplished and delightful, it doesn't quite soar like its predecessor."
"The songs and animation are very good, things liven up considerably in a spectacular finale, and the small children with whom I watched it emerged from the cinema with no complaints."
"The good: The sequel is gorgeous and funnier than its predecessor and has enough positive messages to outweigh the negative. The bad: It's 20 minutes longer than it needs to be... and there's not a song in it that can hold a candle to ""Let It Go."""
"Fairy tales that end in the happily-ever-after don't lend themselves to sequels, and this movie shouldn't have been made. The good news for Disney, I guess, is that someday people will forget it ever was."
The links to the first film are strong...So why does this installment come up short?
"The irony is that while there is much talk throughout about the inevitability and necessity of change, the film only rarely heeds its own lessons."
"By my lights, Frozen 2 is still a plenty enjoyable film, even if it lacks its predecessor's subversive spark."
"Frozen 2 is no soulless retread but rather a much more narratively complex, visually inventive, and thematically interesting follow-up than anticipated. Its reach at times exceeds its grasp, but the effort is consistently admirable."
Is Frozen II definitively bad? No. It's the equivalent of vanilla with little charm and a heaping dose of predictability.
"An unwieldy mixture of Broadway musical, animated adventure story, and message movie about not only the importance of family but the evils of imperialism [that] lacks any hint of genuine magic."
The story is good. It's got good animation. It's got good characters.
Frozen II revives and doubles down on the good and the bad of its 2013 monster hit predecessor.
"Unwilling to let it go, Disney has concocted another magical musical 'Frozen' adventure."
"[I]t's not as good as its predecessor, [but] it's still well within the ""good"" range for kids, families, and anyone who loved the first film and is happy to spend some more time in that world."
In its more artful moments ... the film delivers imagery as memorable as any in the Disney canon.
Frozen II is destined to be one of those movies children will want to see dozens of times.
More of the same works but it is still just that.
"Frozen II offers little in terms of plot or music that will please either the adult or kid Disney fan, and will have audiences wishing they were watching the original film instead."
"It's never surprising, yet its bursts of pictorial imagination - snowflakes that streak like shooting stars - keep you engaged, as do Elsa and Anna, who still aren't waiting for life to happen."
"The animation is more refined, more realistic, and the story isn't a simple rehash of the first installment. Not a bad showing for a piece of pop entertainment designed for the whole family."
"One thing that really sets ""Frozen 2"" apart from its predecessor is the visuals, which are as gorgeous and awe-inspiring as computer animation can possibly get."
"What they bring to the table this time opens up the world only hinted at in 2013 and, in the process, offer answers to questions audiences may never have considered. By doing this, Frozen II becomes something braver, bolder, and, yes, more frozen."
"While not quite as fresh as the original, it still stands tall with its own proto-feminist message of strong girl power and sisters doin' it for themselves--and each other."
"There really does seem to be a desire to advance the story and build on the previous film, and that's what the best sequels do."
"While the visuals sometimes have stunning beauty and motion, there is little on screen or in the soundtrack that feels truly unknown, or carries any of the freshness of the snow that covers Elsa's kingdom."
The story is better but the music isn't quite as good...still #sisterhood and #findingyourself
"Frozen II opens this week in all its sparkly, sugar-coated splendour...it mixes some gloom with the glitter, though..."
Maybe the only purpose Frozen 2's narrative expansion serves is to provide a more compelling foundation for another sequel than the original left for this one.
[Frozen II] forces viewers to consider their own lives and question if what they have comes at someone else's expense.
"Frozen 2 is a darker journey, but illuminated with breathtaking animation and stunning action scenes."
"Frozen II is never quite as magical or affecting as its predecessor, though it is certainly engaging enough."
"It feels rich for a sequel to center its thematic concerns around the inevitability of change, only to back away from that kind of change at the last possible minute."
What actually takes the wind out of Frozen 2′s many attempts at epic gust is its repeated failure to imagine and entertain.
It's hard to see how the same team who made something so cool in 2013 could deliver something so - there's no other word for it - lukewarm.
"It's definitely a step-down from the original, particularly in terms of the songs and how they're used. But Frozen 2 will please those it's meant to."
"Disney has, in turn, made Elsa into a gorgeous incel; a closed-loop of unfulfilled desire who soaks up the sister cuddles as an alternative next best thing."
"It adds up to a marginally more interesting experience than the first ""Frozen,"" but this sequel would have benefited from venturing a touch further into the unknown."
"For a film designating its story to be about a journey into the unknown, Frozen 2 is jarringly predictable, painstakingly toothless, and self-defeating in its mad dash to the end credits."
"Frozen 2 is a tale of two halves. Fortunately for everyone, the better of those two halves comes second and leaves you feeling mostly fulfilled when walking out of the theater."
It will no doubt amuse and maybe even enrapture its target audience.
"Props to Disney for spending six years ensuring that Frozen 2 isn't a mere cash-in, but an artistically finer film."
"If ""Frozen"" yawed toward fairy tale romance threatened by magic, its sequel rights the ship with magic bringing everyone back down to earth."
"Inspiring, but misses my heartstring pull. Those expecting a sequel to be better than the original? Ya'll need to let it go. What Frozen 2 offers is hope for future Disney Princess sequels."
"While the film provides several environmentally conscious nuggets to think about, its voyage into the unknown still travels the safe path."
