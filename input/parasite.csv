review
"It is sadistic, angry and dark and has a lot to say about the system. This is the world we live in."
"""Parasite"" has already made history for South Korea as the country's first film to win a Best Picture Academy Award. There are some moments I can't wrap my head around though, and one of them was the inclusion of Illinois State into the dialogue."
"Cinematography, score, editing… everything’s absolutely perfect. Nothing is placed without purpose. Not a single line of dialogue is wasted. It would be a shame if anyone fails to watch this magnificent movie just because it’s in a foreign language."
"Radically different films such as Knives Out, Us and Joker ... have all expressed the same social criticism. Parasite is perhaps the most pointed, explicitly showing how economic inequality brings out the worst in everyone, rich and poor alike."
"Bong Joon Ho’s many-sided, dark social satire is a cunning and resourceful commentary on South Korea’s economic inequality. Why it works is the relevance of that system across societies of every nation."
"These tiny details underline the inherent horror, and concur with the genre-defying essence of the story..."
Parasite will move you like nothing else.
It is the last good thing that has happened since the shutdown...
Visually stunning and searing satire...
"Incredible storytelling and examination of the class structure in Korea... Strong characterisation and performances create empathy from audiences, themselves becoming parasites to the film as host. Clinging on for dear life until the thrilling conclusion."
"Delicate directing and immaculate production design make Parasite the masterpiece it is. Its social-study script belongs in a lab, as it comes with storytelling lessons that transcend language. Reason why it became universal. [Full review in Spanish]"
"With a delicious black comedy edge, some surprising jolts of heartfelt emotion, and a violent throat punch when you’re least expecting it, “Parasite” is a movie that keeps you engaged and guessing."
"Here is a dark comedy from the great Bong Joon-Ho about class warfare that, depending on your mood, you may find to be a work of genius or too self-indulgent. One thing is certain, you’ve never seen anything quite like it."
Bong Joon-ho's Parasite is a wryly detailed and superbly scripted portrait of contemporary class rage.
"This is a filmmaker working at the top of his game, aided by brilliant satirical writing that feels as culturally relevant as it is emotionally resonant. It is a flawless knockout in every sense of the word."
"Though Bong calls Parasite a ""tragicomedy"" and layers the material with lively humor and his signature tonal playfulness, it's also his most furious and most fatalistic picture to date."
"Bong Joon-ho has created something with Parasite thats darkly humorous, compelling, dramatic, poignant, and bittersweet all at the same time."
Episode 52: Jojo Rabbit / The Lighthouse / Parasite
A twist-laden narrative that effortlessly shapeshifts from comedy to drama to thriller with liquid ease.
"My respect for Bong Joon-Ho is up in the sky, because he and everyone else involved in this movie pretty much knocked it out of the park on multiple fronts."
"A bonkers, beautiful, radical, and drop-dead intelligent dark satirical tale of social inequality [and the] mock egalitarian weirdness of late capitalism."
"Like Ki-Jung, Park So-dam is the standout in a film filled with strong performances."
"Parasite finds a way to be visually stunning, thematically resonant, horrifyingly tragic and fantastically gripping while fooling the audience into thinking they are having the time of their life."
"It is such a clash of different genres and moods that it may as well be considered genreless, and yet it all somehow comes together in such a masterful way that you cannot help but leave the theater in a state of awe."
"Parasite is a master class in storytelling, providing one of the finest examples of how to entertain the masses while still telling a deep and meaningful story."
I'll just come out and say it. Parasite is a masterpiece.
The film feels too insincere and hypocritical to take genuinely seriously on its theme of social injustice.
"Boon Joon Ho keeps us thoroughly enthralled as the story unfolds, deftly calibrating shifts in tone between satire, screwball farce, black comedy and horror, and also nimbly balancing our sympathies between the two families."
"A splendid take on class inequalities that force the audience to question who is the parasite, the rich or the poor."
"Not content with a basic premise of crime and punishment, director Bong Joon Ho goes a step further, eventually corkscrewing off on a tangent that drags out the running time."
"Precisely controlled and drolly ironic in tone even as its events grow more and more berserk, Parasite is always entertaining, foremost."
Every actor brings different nuances to their respective portrayals and is completely in sync with the picture's seriocomic tone.
Bong's work was leading to this galvanizing movie which has really shocked people into further questioning the wealth gap and understanding the precariousness of the urban underclass in an era of climate change...
"One of the best films of the decade and of Korean cinema (a nation that, by the way, has one of the most interesting filmographies of contemporary times). Its greatest strength is telling a story small but so powerful... [Full review in Spanish]"
"Bong's film is one which reveals itself in layers and it's almost impossible to categorise - it's at once a black comedy, thriller, horror, family drama and an allegory about class."
An unusual director with his antenna attuned to social class...Bong has emerged over the past decade as a globally significant filmmaker.
Parasite was the single best film I saw in 2019.
"The most impressive part? That even though this is a crowd-pleaser, it somehow manages to be marvelously depressing in ways that don't hit until after the credits roll."
Gripping.
"It's important to go in as fresh as possible to enjoy the film's juicy surprises, which are unraveled with the craft of a master, steadily building characters into the scheme, inviting our complicity, then yanking out the rug."
What starts off as a light-hearted comedy ends up becoming a bloody thriller as Bong intertwines slapstick comedy scenes and tense artful schemes.
The fallout of socio-economic disparities that pit one class of people against another has rarely been put on the big screen with the kind of savage candour and devastating intensity that Bong brings.
"Bong Joon-ho masterfully sets the table, and then delivers a raw, brutal critique to society. A masterpiece and one of 2019 best films. [Full review in Spanish]"
Parasite is a stunning achievement. It's a work that is as keenly prescient as it is superbly crafted.
"I can say, without fear of being wrong, that this is one of the best movies of the year. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Parasite is a masterful piece of social satire and dark comedy, a scathing portrait of both the upper and lower classes."
"In the movie's most vivid set piece, Bong demonstrates that water (to use a euphemism) rolls downhill: A downpour that is picturesque at the level of the mansion becomes a flood by the time it washes into the poor family's vulnerable neighborhood."
"under the guise of an engaging, thrilling, rip-roaring piece of entertainment..., Bong has delivered a spectacular deconstruction of the late-capitalist society in which we all must live together - if not all on the same level."
"Settling in for a narrative about a family trying to keep it together by overpowering the capitalistic battle, Bong Joon-ho has constructed a low-key tragic comedy that insists on being more than just that."
PARASITE is Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece.
"It's very rare a film makes a step-change in what is going on and the dynamics of the characters, and makes that work as well it does here."
"...director Bong is also working on other levels, not only making all of its characters relatable - the Parks are really quite sweet people, if a little lacking in self-awareness - but telling his story with a healthy dose of uproarious slapstick."
"A picture that audaciously devours the force of convention and transforms it into a feverish undercurrent, driving what can only be described as an engine through the odyssey of mayhem."
"Kudos go to Bong's sleight-of-hand narrative approach, as he seamlessly defying genres by alternating from drama to comedy to thriller and back again over the course of its 131-minute running time."
Some satire but not at its best. And ugliness filled in the rest.
A film that is genre-defying and free of the restraints of conventional storytelling.
"With each passing day, Bong Joon-ho's class-conscious thriller about a family that lives in a sub-basement-and the blissfully naïve rich family they wind up working for-becomes even more prescient."
"Get ready for thrills and laughter. As the credits roll, all the layers of meaning in every shot, character and object become clear and you can't wait to spread the word. This is what cinema does best -- entertain, provoke, create discussion."
"Everything is superbly controlled and nailed to the point at which you begin to question, how is this possible?"
"Parasite surprised me over and over. I constantly had no idea what was going to happen next. But what did happen, was amazing and extremely well done."
"When the history of this moment in world cinema is written, Parasite will take its place as the movie that got the moment right."
"A monumental achievement in film and the rare film that goes from ""very good"" to ""historically great"" in its final act."
"The smartest mainstream film about class made in many years, Bong Joon-ho's Parasite lays bare the lie that hard work can bring anyone closer to their dreams."
"Never let the audience off the hook, Hitchcock once said. Ho achieves this in spades and with more than one hook."
"[A] funny, inventive, scary film."
"From his opening shots, Bong Joon-Ho establishes the upstairs/downstairs dynamic of his razorsharp, bleakly funny, unmistakably furious skewering of capitalism and class divides."
"Bong hoped to give his film a classic sheen by creating a 'b&w' version. He needn't have done this: with or without color, Parasite will certainly be classic enough."
"It is bracing, audacious, jarring, challenging and exciting, a devastating social satire realized with precision and intelligence in every perfectly constructed frame."
It's a very good story.
The acting's amazing.
I think it's a career peak for [Bong Joon-ho].
Watching that drama -- the bricks sort of build and then topple -- is so satisfying.
"Thinking very metaphorically may not lead to our salvation, but the consciousness it induces just might."
Parasite provides a potential turning point for international films in America. Bong Joon-Ho's mystery drama will capture the hearts and minds of audiences worldwide
The movie itself - message aside - is remarkably entertaining.
"It conveys very clear messages about classism and discrimination, [all through] an entertaining and visually arresting story. [Full review in Spanish]"
"It's a splendid film, beautifully acted and realised, which manages to be both entertaining and profound."
A breath-taking cinematic accomplishment that will have you talking for days
"[Bong Joon-ho]'s work is as playful as it is sincere and revelatory. He'll make you feel at home, and then rip the rug out from under you."
This is what a true masterpiece looks like.
Bong delivers a stunning return to form with this newest venture.
"What's to be said about this film that hasn't already been said? ... because there is so much to take in, like a Da Vinci painting, the film reveals secrets and hidden meanings until you're left breathless..."
Cinema of the highest form. No headline will ever convey the power of Parasite - it's a masterpiece that has to be seen to be believed.
"What makes Parasite such a good film is that it tells a story first and foremost, so the social commentary whilst ever present isn't so overpowering that you cannot just enjoy the story being told."
The parasites have parasites.
"Ingeniously written and directed, plus faultlessly acted, this is one of the great movie experiences of this or any year."
"Despite the occasionally slow pace, an impressively strong finish means you'll enjoy finding out."
An impeccable script. [Full review in Spanish]
"Plugging into our universal disquiet about the inequality between the haves and have-nots, Bong has fashioned a darkly enjoyable class-war thriller in which the real monster is global capitalism itself, but there is nothing heady or didactic about it."
"One's left to wonder who's parasitically living off whom? The Kims off the Parks, or the Americans off their anti-communist allies?"
Parasite is a completely gripping and utterly entertaining masterpiece in which writer-director Bong Joon Ho has poured all his craft and vision into.
A tragicomic masterclass that will get under your skin and eat away at your cinematic soul.
"This serpentine, unclassifiable piece stands as a highlight among the director's already glittering career."
"Far from hiding, the film's beguiling charm stokes the deeply dystopian vision of its maker. In Bong's world, despite tokens like a cell phone or pizza dinners, social mobility doesn't quite exist."
"[I]ts delivery - mixing social satire, twisty plotting and Hitchcockian tension - a masterclass in serious-minded but accessible mainstream filmmaking."
I think this film is as close to perfect as anything I have seen in the last 10 years. It's just fantastic.
[A]s a filmmaker [Bong's] less interested in finger-wagging admonishments than he is in taking us to uncomfortable places with outré plot twists that deepen and reframe what we think we know about the characters.
"Using industrial-strength social satire, [Bong Joon Ho] strips the veneer off the myth of classlessness, giving an outrageously entertaining instant classic."
"While Parasite has won critical acclaim worldwide, seeming to strike a chord with audiences for its raw class commentary, the movie's message is not clear cut. It's a dark comedy, but by the end you're not sure if the joke is on you after all."
"It works on every level which is, perhaps, fitting for a film about levels and whether you are at the top or bottom in life."
"Parasite is quite simply a supreme feat of film-making, a tense and hilarious jewel box of a film that draws you deeper and deeper into its wicked, absurdist satire."
"Parasite works as entertainment and analysis, treat and treatise."
An imaginative comedy-thriller with darkness at its core.
The word masterpiece is often too easily used... But you can easily understand why Parasite has been given that label by so many because finding a reason to disagree feels just as redundant.
"Though we largely root for the Kims, Bong doesn't allow anything as simple as rich versus poor, good versus bad. No wonder this movie speaks to global audiences - it's a parable about our capitalist world."
"A film that always has two thoughts in its head at once, a spectacular epic and tightly wound chamber piece, chicly sophisticated, brutal as a hammer."
extraordinary
"It takes a while to get there, but it sticks its landing."
A miracle of a film. It feels like Bong Joon-ho's already extraordinary career has been building to this: a riotous social satire that's as gloriously entertaining as it is deeply sardonic.
Bong builds the rocambolesque plot of Parasite from a solid architectural skeleton. [Full Review in Spanish]
"It's a gripping, existential, horrifying study of a nightmarish world - except that it is true."
"We see what we want. We want what we see. Woe unto the collateral damage we leave. There may be no more original schemes, but the best movie of 2019 is more fascinated by original sins and the shapes they take in the here and now."
"Intrigue, violence, gore and humor show us a Korea in which not everything that shines is gold. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Parasite is staggeringly good, a remarkable piece of filmmaking that immerses and unnerves. Bong Joon Ho's direction is that of a maestro, of an auteur unleashed."
"A masterful genre chronicle of savage injustice and a master-class in genre filmmaking from Bong Joon-ho, Parasite is a classic must-see for anyone who loves film."
"Quite simply put, Parasite is a thrilling masterpiece from Bong Joon-ho, a director at the height of his powers offering a film that is profoundly entertaining, wonderfully realised, and thought-provoking."
"In Parasite, Bong doesn't appear to be expressing empathy for the poor. Nor does he seem to be pointing fingers at the rich. He is, instead, questioning the very nature of mankind; its self-centred ingratitude and its propensity to create divisions."
It really is a must-see.
"Very few movies in recent years have left you unsure what's going to happen next, but even when you do, it's still a compelling watch. Quite simply, Parasite is a masterpiece."
"Stunning and intricate, it is simply brilliant."
"A deep and complex narrative, rich in social commentary, is intricately wrapped within layer upon layer of different complementary genres and tones."
"It plays like a brilliant con job comedy in the first half, before switching to total wacko mode at the end, with knives out and bloody. I liked the first half of this Jekyll and Hyde film a lot. The second half, not so much."
"Bong Joon-Ho here constructs a powerful and intense hybrid of genres, themes, and observations that grow and acquire sense as the story, which is full of rich details, unfolds. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Humiliation is transformed into resentment and fantasy into reality. [Full Review in Spanish]
Parasite is true to itself even when it stops being palatable.
"As with his previous features such as Snowpiercer and The Host, Bong has created an intense drama laced throughout with scathing commentary."
"Bong Joon Ho has delivered one of the most well-assembled and compelling films of all time, which flawlessly navigates humor, despair, satire, and elements of thrilling horror to create an experience I won't soon forget."
"""Parasite"" flips through about ten different genres and takes the best bits of each; it feels like a relaxing buffet that expresses and sparks a love of cinema."
Parasite is a major accomplishment and a must-see film for anyone who loves cinema.
Bong builds the smallest moments into something monumental.
"No doubt Asian capitalist interests are well-served in the end, there won't be rioting in the streets on the back of this one. A film is hardly effective satire if it doesn't point up a route to radical change."
... playful until it becomes diabolical... only then does (writer/director) Bong Joon Ho show exactly the cards he's holding.
The only real question is how high you'll rank it in your top films of 2019 or the 2010s decade list.
"Unexpected, quirky, funny, horrific, dramatic - all of these things, but also just a bit tedious in parts. Not your average movie for sure."
"Somewhere, the ghost of Alfred Hitchcock is smiling with glee."
Parasite deserves to take its rightful place as one of the decade's finest films.
"Parasite is one of those beautiful rarities in cinema, a clever art-house title with much to say that is riotously entertaining and easily accessible."
We are facing a remarkable degree of narrative skill. [Full Review in Spanish]
Things get darker still... But Bong never lets the movie's dramatic tonal shifts derail the narrative momentum...
A splendid movie. [Full Review in Spanish]
A revolutionary film. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Parasite makes us see a landscape of injustice that we normally don't want to see. It feels uncomfortable, but it offers us plenty of material for reflection. Bravo! [Full Review in Spanish]"
Bong Joon-ho succeeds in showing us that the worst monster of our reality is the system that we have built. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Bong is crude, direct, ruthless, and at the same time refined. The director doesn't deliver a moralizing discourse. On the contrary, he offers a crescendo where suspense and the grotesque come together. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"an elaborate thriller that at first seems to pit the have's against the have-not's, but is ultimately about how the have not's are forced to turn against each other in the mad clamor for whatever dwindling social and economic crumbs they can find"
We are before a remarkable degree of narrative skill. [Full review in Spanish]
"a parable about two families in Korea-one rich but dim, one poor but clever-and what happens when the poor household decides to scam the rich."
"Just when we think we know where the narrative is headed, Bong pulls the rug out from under us via turns that are occasionally dazzling, yet always organic, thanks to meticulous foreshadowing and his knack for slowly building an atmosphere of dread."
Bong Joon-ho delivers something really special: the best film of 2019. [Full review in Spanish]
"Parasite was too on the nose too often for me to give it my full heart. However, I loved an ambiguity at its core..."
"This is a mature, beautifully crafted piece of work and much cleverer than it initially appears."
[A] fantastic film. [Full review in Spanish]
"The conversation about the gap between social classes is cynical, fun, and exasperating, because Bong doesn't simply talks about rich versus poor, but things that few people dare to talk about. [Full review in Spanish]"
"I haven't seen another film that pinned down the essence of the year, wriggling and squirming, with such eviscerating precision. It's not just a film; it's a vivisection."
The only thing that you should expect is the unexpected.
"This isn't just a killer picture on all of the standard levels, however. Contemplating society's growing class collisions and inequities, Parasite also makes a killer statement."
"Parasite is cinema at its very best, and will continue to be lauded as a timeless masterpiece."
"It's the perfect mix of the director's penchants for tidy symbolism and unhinged tonal shifts, with a strong ensemble cast led by longtime Bong favorite Song Kang-ho."
Parasite is a well-designed kick down the stairs that you cannot see coming. Rarely does a movie take you on the kind of trip this one does.
"If the movie is a Rorschach of who you identify as parasite and host, it's a test you're just as likely to fail; a filmgoing experience that refuses to fit into any box, and forces viewers to breathe the dangerous air outside of it too."
"Let's just say that by ""Parasite's"" conclusion, what started out as a comedy of manners has become a furious snarl of rage and his most arresting social satire yet."
"Obviously, these are not new themes or issues unheard of within the global economy, but it's not often a filmmaker finds a way to portray it in such unique shades of grey."
"Even if its social message about culture and class (Alfred-Hitchcock-by-way-of-Karl-Marx) is laid on too thick in the end, this Parasite slithers most agreeably."
Parasite is a triumph by a director who still hasn't really made a misstep.
"It isn't an easy ride, and as with life in the non-metaphorical world, the destination is uncertain. You'll see strange and wonderful things along the way."
The entertainment this combination of crime thriller and social drama offers is undeniable.
"It's so easy for otherwise good and normal people to do terrible things, and it's never entirely possible for them to escape their sins."
"[Parasite] has so much to offer, you'll want to see it more than once."
"Impeccable, sustaining shocking plot twists and tonal shifts between suspense, poignant family drama and slapstick farce without ever sacrificing its visual flair and impudent sense of humour."
"This movie is scary and funny and utterly beguiling. If you haven't seen it, you must."
"Has other, more interesting, uncomfortable things on it's mind - and the most uncomfortable of all is [when] you start to realize none of these people are as bad as you want them to be."
Parasite is a mature and complex examination of the cyclical nature of the haves and have-notes. It's probably the best film I've seen this year.
"This is a movie about messages, codes and plans, subterranean communications and misperceptions. Parasite may even be a ""message movie,"" though it has an artistry that term conceals."
Parasite ups the ante by presenting the (sometimes literal) moral depths of the dream of class mobility.
"Bong drags human greed and its consequences into the light with his lacerating wit, unabashed brutality and heart-wrenching tragedy, turning ""Parasite"" into an audacious and explosive parable for our times."
a savage and spectacular social satire
"Parasite is a well-made, engaging, and memorable film exploring class disparity in Korea. With its darkly comedic tone, Parasite manages to entertain, while crafting a surprising and socially relevant experience."
"While the off-beat nature of the narrative surely will not appeal to everyone, those with a desire to be taken on a thrilling ride of many twists and turns will be rewarded with an unpredictable and unsettling sharp class dissection."
I was just glued to the screen...amazing.
"I tried to predict what was happening, and I was wrong every time. I like that...the acting was a bit different, and it took some time to get up to speed, but I really enjoyed it."
Bong effortlessly blends the horrific and the comic en route to the icebox talk that has viewers questioning their own attitudes and beliefs through the unanswered mysteries of the story.
"It is a difficult task to review films like Parasite, because in the end you have almost certainly run out of superlatives with which to apply to it."
"The cast is great in this film, the performances are really dope and l you really get into both families."
"In a demonstration of masterful filmmaking director Bong Joon Ho's (Snowpiercer, The Host) latest film is uncategorizable and that is a great thing."
Parasite is at once a comedy and a Hitchcockian thriller with shades of mid-period Cohen Bros thrown in for good ironic measure. This film is a solid must-see for anyone who values quality filmmaking with something to say.
"Bong Joon-ho's magnificent genre-bending movie Parasite is a funny, deeply satirical look at class divisions, told through the intersecting lives of three families in Seoul."
"Parasite is a carnivorous and ferocious feat of filmmaking, bloodsport framed with a formal brilliance and brutally comic verve. It's one of the year's best."
"Bong knows better than to deliver a lecture. Instead, he wants nails chewed to the cuticle and armrests bent, achieving such reactions with magnificent editorial flow."
"Parasite attests to a filmmaker at the peak of powers, telling precisely the story he wants to tell in a way that showcases his distinctive virtuosity."
"It is a sitcom with teeth and haunting moral echoes, no small amount of vulgarity and a smart streak of comedy."
Bong packs his frames with visual symbolism that speaks to contemporary times and writes characters on both sides of the economic divide that feel relatable and well-rounded.
"There's little doubt that Parasite earns the title of masterpiece, and will only grow in the public consciousness for decades to come."
"Bong Joon-ho's suspenseful, timely thriller that's perhaps one of the best movies of the year."
"The film is sarcastically brilliant, hysterical, clever, and frenzied. The cinematography is glorious! My advise, go in not knowing the details!"
"There's not a doubt in my mind that Parasite is one of the best films of 2019, if not the best film of the year."
"I'm still in considerable pain from watching Parasite, days later. It's that great of a film."
"With Parasite, Bong Joon-Ho has produced a brilliant social commentary, and what might well be the best film of 2019."

"South Korean director Bong Joon-Ho's ""Parasite"" contains everything that's exciting about his films: a grand fluidity of camera movements and a framing of shots that makes you look into corners just in case something's lurking. B"

"A scathing satire-farce-tragedy-horror... You might not like where it goes, but you certainly won't forget it."

"Parasite is a great film all right. It is not, I think, to be missed by anyone who seriously cares about movies."
Filmmaker Bong does a superb job of immediately drawing the viewer into the deliberately-paced proceedings...

"The writing is fantastic, as well as the acting, production design and score"
"A trenchant commentary on the economic divide that exists in today's South Korea, one made all the keener by Bong's ability to meld elements of comedy, satire, suspense and horror...one of the year's best films."
"Parasite very much takes place in our world. Perhaps a slightly heightened version of it, but ours nonetheless. Mixing that with his usual dark humor and oddly specific characters, Bong Joon-ho has created an experience like no other."
"That's not ""savage commentary."" That's condescension. This is by far the filmmaker's most commercially successful work to date..."
Parasite is unique in its treatment of class and solidarity and is a singular cinematic experience.
"A meticulously crafted, satirical thriller that proves to be [Bong Joon] Ho's most thematically rich project to date."
"Parasite is a beautiful movie, wonderfully acted, impeccably shot."

"It's a fitting movie for our times, and Joon-ho delivers with uncompromising clarity and vision. See it before the inevitable American remake sands down all its razor sharp edges."

"Joon-ho makes it all increasingly funny at first, until an out-of-nowhere twist sends both families into a sparkling but serious assortment of genre-mixed rides and wrinkles."

"Just when you thought a Bong Joon-ho movie couldn't get more weird or wonderful, he delivers a masterpiece."
"The bassline of modern art is thumping and pulsating with a fury about inequality. Often, that sound gets understandably but simplistically distilled into ""rich bad, poor good"" messaging. Parasite absolutely defies a quick synthesizing of its message."

Seals a serious case for Bong Joon-ho as one of the great filmmakers of all time.

Parasite is a must-watch in order to get a full picture of the world cinema scene in 2019.
"Perhaps the greatest compliment one can pay ""Parasite"" is you're never sure what's going to happen next."

The fact that it manages to blend dark comedy and suspense while also being accompanied by unforgettable crisp visuals makes it stand out from most films released within years.
"A standing ovation to cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong, who also lensed the visually impressive Snowpiercer, for setting the perfect tone."
"Bong Joon Ho shifts style from one genre to the next throughout the film, but always finds the universal humanity that brings the audience in for more than just laughs and thrills."
It's just so rare to get a movie that actually surprises you these days...
"There was so much going on, and all of it came together for one sensible thing...this is the kind of stuff Hollywood makes because they can't make it for themselves."
"A masterful commentary on class, Parasite issues a new guideline for contemporary horror."
There's no doubt that the idea is interesting and brings about ingenious and really funny scenes. [Full review in Spanish]
"[The Park's] garage door is the curtain, the grand window looking out from the living room onto the yard is the proscenium, and everything that occurs within its reflection is this symbiotic tragicomedy..."
"You don't want to know too much about it in advance. Parasite unfolds in such a surprising way that watching it work on an audience - through levels of delight, shock and disbelief - is part of the fun."
"Parasite plumbs the depths of class divisions and personal delusion, as well as the fragility of a social order that seems secure."
"Taking on the disturbingly universal issue of class disparity, the filmmaker has crafted not just a brilliantly sharp and cutting satire, but also what unfurls as a shocking and dramatic thriller with more than a few surprises up its sleeve."
Bong Joon-Ho's Lunatic Must-See New Film is His Best and Most Bonkers
"The resulting film offers an at turns hilarious and deeply unsettling look at class and survival, its essence echoed in the environments the characters inhabit."
"A condescending, pessimistic portrayal of human nature, bereft of class consciousness or ideology..."
"It's a nearly perfect film, from Bong's masterful use of framing and visual language and control of a wildly shifting tone to the performances (all terrific) to the commentary on class division."
"The entire cast is prepared to make the family unlikable at some level, but this should be a starmaking turn for Park So-dam. Her performance as Ki-jeong and her alter ego, Jessica the art student from Chicago, is raw, caustic genius."
"The cleverness of PARASITE unfolds in slight deviations from what we expect... Mistakes, misperceptions, and misunderstandings accumulate, like heavy rains at the bottom of a long staircase-a drip, a drizzle, a torrent, a deluge."
A crazy game of poker. It'll keep you on your toes and will have you hunkering down like a moth to a flame.
"It's a film specifically about false surfaces (both figurative and literal), confidence games, and lies."
"Like Joker, Parasite brilliantly explores the haves vs the have nots and how it's becoming an explosive situation. A masterful piece of filmmaking by Bong Joon Ho."
Fun and unsettling. [Full Review in Spanish]
Parasite is deliciously mischievous and a masterwork of pure and utter deceit with a mesmerizing conclusion that leaves you breathless and reflective.
One of the year's best films. Parasite is a fascinating commentary on society's worst features. [Full review in Spanish].
Parasite radically shifts tones over its wildly entertaining two-hour-plus running time.
"""Parasite"" may be the work that makes (Bong Joon-ho) more of a household name. Many of the best elements from his previous films are on display here, and if there's one film that should serve as an introduction to his style, it's this one."
"Bong Joon Ho makes genre movies about ideas. His films turn ideology into action, and every shot in 'Parasite' is some sort of argument."
Parasite is an appropriately enigmatic title for a satire that cuts both ways.
Beautiful! Brutal! and Brilliant! This Korean comedy thriller is more like two films in one. Director Bong Joon-Ho (Snowpiercer) has carefully thought out this clever take on the haves and have-nots that we'll call US Plus!
"...like Shoplifters' ugly twin brother, who's kept hidden in the basement."
"A deliciously twisted thriller-comedy akin to a home invasion flick, filled to the brim with meaning and dripping with directorial mastery."
"It gives you a lot to think about, with no clear heroes and extreme moral ambiguity."
"[Joon-ho]'s a master of his craft, accounting for the most minute of details while making it look like almost no work at all. His films exert a cool casualness despite their often complicated webs of plots and chameleon-esque tone."
Economic disparity may be the greatest subject of the twenty-first century for intimate horror.
Joon-ho is an excellent filmmaker and this might just be his piece-de-resistance.
This is the best movie of the year... A tonal marvel.
"An absolutely extraordinary achievement on every conceivable level, even though I think it's a bit of a cheat."
"It's an ingenious satire of class that goes to some shockingly dark places. But it's also so, SO funny, finding humor in all sorts of places that the movies rarely do"
You'll watch knowing you're in the hands of a master filmmaker...
"It's pure-strain Bong all the way through, surprising and unsubtle in all his appealing glory."
"Surprising in its observations and developments, the film is has all the makings of one destined for rewatch and deeper examination in perpetuity - a film with the power to continue to reveal things about how we interact and how we survive."
"""Parasite"" expresses consequential ideas that matter to the filmmaker about the way we live today, and the prejudice and malice we create for ourselves and others."
Let's just get this out of the way: Parasite is the best film of 2019.
"Throughout, the director's camerawork and mise en scene are impressively subtle, carefully parsing out information about characters and setting to force viewers to stay alert to the tiniest details."
"One of the best movies of 2019, Bong Joon Ho's latest is a film of dramatic power, innovative comedy, romantic poetry and melancholy beauty."
"One of the year's best, Bong Joon Ho's Parasite is an absurdly masterful dissection of division and greed, and a thunderously assorted filmgoing experience."
"Scathingly brilliant, satirical and exquisitely frenzied."
"By returning to familiar themes and family values, Bong has again latched on to the collective mindset with a touch and a tease of the outré."
"""Parasite"" isn't really a monster movie. Yet on at least one of its nearly infinite levels it is - and the monsters are us."
"Having dramatized the struggle of rich versus poor in wildly lurid terms, he brings the conflict to its dreadful conclusion with the simplest, smallest, most everyday gesture possible."
