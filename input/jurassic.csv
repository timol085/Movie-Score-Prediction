review
"After a slow and choppy start, the action picks up to a brisk pace and is unrelenting straight through to the final — somewhat sappy — montage."
I have always admired the sense of urgency and danger this franchise was able to bring to the table. Unfortunately this uninspired sequel has overstayed its welcome due to its overdrawn runtime.
"This latest offering in the franchise is a painful failure. Gone is all of the magic of the original movie having been replaced by a convoluted story, tired characters and a technology that now seems archaic."
"Written by Trevorrow and Emily Carmichael, Jurassic World's narrative is an oddball situation, and almost feels as if two films have been haphazardly mashed together."
"the definition of an Amusement Park. Fun, silly,crowded,nasty,& exhausting… but in the end you look back & go that was kinda fun! Mixing the old & new cast had some great moments but I love how practical a lot of dinosaurs were,overall it’s not that bad"
"Jurassic World: Dominion is impressive in its ability to flush away all the good will of the films that came before it. By the 90-minute mark, the audience is almost rooting for the locusts to win."
"A massive disappointment on virtually every level. The cast, visuals, and score might save this from being a complete trainwreck, but not from miserably failing to deliver an epic conclusion to a saga that deserved nothing less than that."
"According to studies, land-based animal extinctions occur every 27 million years, give or take. In the case of the Jurassic franchise, they occur every sequel."
"Might be a disappointment, but it's still an improvement over Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdo/m."
The final chapter of the Jurassic World trilogy looks to bring closure to the series but winds up repeating itself in odd and disappointing fashion.
"This is 2nd best out of the Jurassic World trilogy. It's very brutal at times, it feels like the characters are lot more likable & even the action feels much more thrilling. My issue is that this doesn't feel like a apocalyptic scenario that it should be"
Most of the sins of Jurassic World Dominion would be forgivable if the movie were more fun.
Jurassic World: Dominion is the worst thing to happen to the dinosaurs since that meteor 65 million years ago. This is how a franchise dies. With raptor-less applause.
"A disappointing end to something that could've been great, and hopefully the last we'll see of the franchise for a while - until they can come up with something really new."
"Jurassic World Dominion succeeds because of the nostalgia of seeing Dr. Settler, Dr. Grant, and Dr. Malcolm working together again, but ultimately their storyline does nothing to improve upon the ideas presented in Jurassic World."
"At one point Dr. Sattler, viewing the majesty of the replicated dinosaurs, says, ""You never get used to it."" Except here's the problem: you actually do. Familiarity with CGI monsters breeds, well, not exactly contempt. Mostly just boredom."
"If you didn't know better, you'd think Chris Pratt had never acted before."
Viewers seeking a watchable combination of marauding visual effects and human actors running for their lives can find fun in this. It is only if anybody is seeking something more than that will the problems start.
"Colin Trevorrow cannot access a single iota of magic of the Steven Spielberg classic that started it all — without resorting to cheap nostalgia. He still tries though, but it's the equivalent of a T-rex chasing its own tail with its tiny-ass arms."
"Jurassic World Dominion might be the new best-of-a-bum-bunch-of-sequels, but that's hardly a cause for celebration."
We could just “leave our brains at the door.” But I can’t imagine that’s what made people fall in love with this franchise in the first place.
"It has an intriguing crisis at its core, but ultimately succumbs to the same problems its predecessors did in that the screenplay is extremely weak, once more padding the film out to an absurd runtime with monotonous action sequences."
"""Dominion"" never really lives up to its promise."
The latest film seems to have forgotten one of the delights of dinosaur nerdery: imagining the world without humans.
"This unnecessary sequel is unbearable, unwatchable, and too incoherent to suffer through"
"While there's plenty of spectacle to go around, the focus on corporate espionage and locusts wastes the premises potential."
Some terrific set pieces and the return of characters we’ve grown to know and love helps a lot even if it keeps anyone from really doing something with the concept. But by this point what else is anyone expecting from a Jurassic Park sequel?
"You could fracture its logic with a single eyelash, when it flutters down upon being dislodged by your many, many eyerolls in response to this high-order top-shelf lobotomized nincompooped drivel."
It is a rather boring sequel that gets lost uselessly between chases and computer-generated dinosaurs. [Full review in Spanish]
So…locusts? They really went with locusts?
A genetically-engineered generic blockbuster is the weakest chapter in the uninspired new trilogy.
"In spite of all the positive elements, it’s unfortunate the film’s biggest obstacle is its own story."
"If ever there was a franchise that proved box office glory wasn't enough to greenlight sequels, this is it. One masterpiece and a handful of middling to bad facsimiles. At least it's over."
"Despite too many characters, iffy pacing and an excessive runtime, this is just an enjoyably loud, dumb summer action film. More horror would have been appreciated, but the Malta sequence alone makes this worth a recommend."
"Despite its extremely messy story, if looked at as a '50s B-movie matinee, it's not too bad."
The scenes are disjointed; the film lacks heart as not enough focus is given to the main characters’ story.
"Director Colin Trevorrow just about limps over the finishing line with Dominion and while the script probably needed another round of edits, he directs the film with enough passion towards the franchise that it’ll do just fine."
"Even if the movie as a whole isn’t good (and it isn’t, not really), it doesn’t matter, because it definitely delivers on the dinosaurs, and hey – if you’re not down for various flavors of dino-action, then what are we even doing here?"
"As you can probably tell by now, the narrative resembles a ball of wool after a confrontation with a baby raptor."
A chaotic film spectacle – but fun while it lasts.
"Jurassic World Dominion is a devolution, and primarily shows that bloated blockbuster franchises keep finding a way to chew up screens, time and attention, no matter the consequences."
You've got two plots fighting with each other as opposed to working with each other... It constantly feels like I'm ping-ponging between two different movies.
"It was entertaining, I guess. It wasn't terrible. It wasn't the worst of the series. It wasn't the best."
"Goldblum aside, it's hard not to feel that the warm-blooded actors are phoning it in a bit."
"The Jurassic World of ever-diminishing returns, for me this was sadly a case of just not enough blood left to pump authentic storytelling through the veins of a waning franchise. For young dino devotees though this should be diverting enough."
"As for special effects, they are quite good and bring the audience into a world that looks real and exciting."
"It is, I’m sorry to say, like watching your favourite band reunite on the world’s biggest stage only to discover that their instruments are out of tune and the roadies have gone home."
"An over-stuffed, over-long creature feature that strays so far from the wonder that first enchanted us that it's hard to see the connective tissue to its predecessor."
For the final film of a very successful franchise you expect more - much more.
"If you are wanting a fun film that you don’t have to think too hard about, this is it."
"In order to keep visual track of all the famous faces, the sweeping vistas that defined the first Jurassic Park film have been chopped up into ‘80s TV-styled midrange shots, leaving a gazillion-dollar production looking cheap."
"This is a feature that is painful to watch. It does nothing with the intriguing world it takes place in and hopes that cheap nostalgia will be enough to get audiences to enjoy the product it is delivering, something not even close to true."
How many ways can you screw up a dinosaur movie?
"There are some stunning visuals and the new dinosaurs are terrific, especially the one that looks like an angry chicken; though they often seem like extras in an overlong potboiler thriller."
"Dominion answers the question ""What if dinosaurs became so commonplace they were no longer exciting?"" by making even the most unique dinosaur encounters so routine and uninspiring that even the people involved cannot muster enthusiasm to be frightened."
"While there’s never really a sense of true danger for our heroes, we get just enough of the range of CGI dinosaurs and their weird traits to keep the film entertaining."
"The latest Jurassic Park sequel is exhausted and running on fumes. Big, loud, annoying fumes."
A decidedly underwhelming sequel...
"The film remains engaging enough, if rather safe."
"It feels more like one of the later entries in the Fast and the Furious franchise than a Jurassic Park/World film, but if you can accept that then you're in for a loud, long and dumb ride that's also a lot of fun."
"JURASSIC PARK was a gift to cinema and truly pushed filmmaking forward. Unfortunately, every sequel experienced the law of diminishing returns. Jurassic World Dominion was no different."
An ugly franchise entry that feels like a contractual obligation by an employee full of hatred. Easily the worst film in the JP universe.
"This is not one of those awful dark, depressing films about an impending genetic apocalypse, although it could have easily been turned into that with a few minor tweaks. This is an entertaining romp, loaded with action, nostalgia and special effects."
"Two and a half hours of the purest adventure with no filters, no breaks, and with a heart as big as the head of a T-Rex."
It's big and dumb.
"Dominion closes the Jurassic World saga worse than expected, wasting legacy characters and trying to squeeze two movies into one, but having none of them focusing on the core elements that made this saga great. A trilogy dumbed down to unexpected levels."
Jurassic World Dominion is an aggressively fine and mostly enjoyable romp that does some things well and others things less so. It’s the epitome of just OK.
"Sloppy screenplay reduces dinosaurs to costars in their own movie, delivers decent fan service and great fx if not a fully satisfying film."
“Jurassic World: Dominion” roars into movie theaters with creative exhaustion nipping at its rapacious dinosaur jaws. The only sense of awe is associated with the aw-shucks disappointment of a missed opportunity.
"Jurassic World Dominion is not a good movie, but in the midst of so much mediocrity, there's some fascinating—albeit breathtakingly silly—worldbuilding that demands to be unpacked."
"The movie’s greatest miscalculation—and I haven’t even gotten to its misuse of its mostly-wonderful cast—is to regard the behemoths as ordinary wildlife, leaving the film completely lacking in moments."
"Nostalgia only gets you so far, and beleaguered director Colin Trevorrow comes close to ruining a legacy."
"Although the lessons about co-existence are clunky, this is a mostly satisfying film for fans of the franchise."
"Granted there are a few threatening dinosaur muzzles here and there, but the movie doesn't dare to sacrifice any of its characters, we're beholding the softest adventure in this saga. [Full review in Spanish]"
"While stuffed with set pieces, Treverrow still lacks the skill to set them up or pay them off. Plus what use are they when no character feels endangered from the creatures we’re no longer sure are that menacing."
"A disjointed mess, plagued by a MacGuffin-filled plot, mediocre action sequences, and a lack of dramatic stakes."
A Jurassic World film where dinosaurs are now free and interacting with the modern world shouldn’t feel this long-winded or this tiresome. Dominion is running on fumes as it tries to offer something new from what is otherwise dried up fossil fuel.
"A creative low point, even by the dead-horse-flogging standards of the previous sequels to Steven Spielberg’s groundbreaking original."
Does the plot make sense? Of course not. But the effects are so impressive that even those with dimming affection for this venerable series will feel satisfied with the result.
"Jurassic World Dominion is overstuffed with characters, lore, plot points, and even action sequences that fail to be exciting, but its greatest flaw is that it’s too obsessed with recalling Jurassic Park for its own good."
Fallen Kingdom broke my brain so fundamentally that I walked away being able to mostly enjoy Dominion as a popcorn flick. Unfortunate that the dinosaurs are essentially bookends to the story and a minor inconvenience.
"Jurassic World Dominion is far from where we started in 1993, but I believe the world is big enough to have both kinds of blockbusters. It’s an extremely flawed but admirable effort, full of dumb cheesy moments, plenty of action, and really cool dinos."
"'Dominion' loses the soul of 'Jurassic Park,' action sequences are downright ugly as dino VFX can't keep up with the ""Wannabe Mission Impossible"" cinematography, and it's overall just the worst kind of manufactured blockbuster cash-in."
"Operating at a full-tilt pace, this sequel is packed with exciting action scenes, has a solid story, compelling bad guys, and features dinosaurs aplenty. In other words, it's everything you’d want out of a summer popcorn flick."
"Jurassic World Dominion is really like being at the biggest, best buffet on the planet and choosing to eat nothing but plain lettuce."
JWD prioritizes fanservice over telling a cogent tale with actual emotional stakes.
"A long, tiring, winding road."
The most concerning takeaway is that director Colin Trevorrow wholeheartedly believes he made a great film here.
"The last time dinosaurs were subjected to a disaster this bad, there was an asteroid involved."
"Not enough dinosaurs, and too much B.D. Wong all sad in a frumpy sweater."
Those dastardly dinos are back (yawn).
Jurassic World: Dominion has its moments but they are few and far between. Revisit the first film instead.
"Dinosaurs walk the Earth, but Jurassic World Dominion gives bugs dominion over the plot. It’s like watching a Godzilla movie where people fend off huge termites while avoiding Godzilla’s feet and atomic breath. ... massively disappointing."
"The film gets the bands back together, merging two trilogies in meagre ways, but never quite sure what it wants to be - Eco revenge tale? Western fantasy? Family drama? Ironic sequel? End result is mixed, but still packs some bite"
"Jurassic World Dominion is not interesting but full of cliches. And, while humans have aged remarkably well, time hasn’t been kind to the dinosaurs..."
"Like a classic Frank Capra film, ""Dominion"" believes in the basic goodness of the common person, especially peripheral characters such as Dodgson's right-hand man Ramsay Cole..."
The latest Jurassic World trades suspense for nostalgia.
Jurassic World Dominion reeks of a series that has run out of steam and has nothing left but the fumes of its past triumphs to keep it on the road. Sadly it seems that it's time for this particular franchise to go extinct.
"The dinosaurs really aren't the focus of the film, which is how Dominion will likely lose viewers who come to watch man fight the prehistoric giants, not man wrestle with moral ambiguity and an impending worldwide famine."
Its not about the humans…what I enjoyed the most was the freaking dinosaurs.
It felt like a lot of ideas and they couldn’t pick the best ones.
"The prehistoric creatures are thriving, but this sixth installment in the  Jurassic series feels tired..."
"With its narrative whiplash, the latest legacy sequel begs the question, why not watch the original instead?"
"Compared to its predecessor, its the most worthwhile to watch…Trevorrow and his team have assembled a variety of spooky dinosaurs, both classic and new. [Full review in Spanish]"
"A fun film with little surprises. People looking for a family film will be happy, but I'm still figuring out my feelings on this ending. It almost feels like the end of the Terminator series, have we outgrown or jumped the Jurassic shark?"
"Dominion features some fun set pieces, mostly charismatic actors, and decent VFX work. It also features a bloated mess of a screenplay and a lead performance that feels curiously inert."
Jurassic World Dominion does next to nothing with what it has nor does it feel like any kind of real finale to what began with the 1993 original or even Trevorrow’s own 2015 reboot.
"You can round up the old gang for the first time in three decades, mix them up with the new gang who’ve been at it for the past seven years, but if you can’t give them all decent dialogue and a powerful story… well, it’s just not going to happen."
I think the best thing for the franchise now is to remain like its dinosaur counterparts… extinct!
"Jurassic World Dominion is not a high point for the franchise, but it’s still reasonably entertaining and delivers where the real stars, the dinosaurs, are concerned."
"Arguably least satisfying and it ends more on a philosophical note, still, there's plenty of fun to be had. Serving up familiar terrors and new thrills on a nostalgic platter, “Jurassic World Dominion” is a quintessential summer blockbuster."
"All concerned have made the audacious decision to relegate the dinosaurs – the marquee attractions, to the status of background extras."
"Generic sequel squanders killer cast, overloads on slick CGI dinosaurs."
Ho hum.
"Because it brings back the human characters who propelled previous installments, it's sentimental, yet it's overstuffed and superficial - resulting in no emotional connection."
"The weakest of the Jurassic World trilogy. It feels like they keep puling back from what we want to see, especially considering the set up the last movie gave us."
"A movie that preys on nostalgia but doesn’t know what to do with any of it, and a film with a massive scale that gets pared down to the same tricks as before, Jurassic World Dominion brings the franchise to an unsatisfying close."
It’s the equivalent of Colin Trevorrow banging pots and pans for two and a half hours to keep you distracted from the fact that nothing you’re seeing really means anything.
"Despite the long-awaited return of the beloved trio of characters, this chaotic and inconsequential entry leads the saga straight to extinction. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Goldblum... has flashes of the requisite Goldblum irritation while dressed and lit as a seventy-year-old leather-jacketed version of Bob Fosse’s serpent from Stanley Donen’s 'The Little Prince.'
Feels like a mishmash of dueling ideas that never fully congeals.
"The action isn't terrible once this clunker gets rolling, but the underlying Frankenworld message of ""can we all get along"" with genetically altered dinos and cloned humans is disturbing."
"Jurassic World Dominion is not the stellar end to the series as we hoped, but there remains a lot of fun to be had here. You just have to ignore the script and focus on what we all came for: dinosaurs attempting to chomp-chomp everyone on screen."
"In pushing dinosaurs to the background in favor of a more conventional, action-adventure ensemble feature, Jurassic World Dominion abandons too much of what made the franchise so reliably entertaining."
The franchise adds two attractive new Black characters and yet this starkly reminds us of how diversity was imagined throughout this six-film saga. The logistics called for more Latinos and an expansion of an Asian American character.
"Jurassic World: Dominion doesn’t tarnish the original’s legacy and delivers a mostly satisfying conclusion to this new trilogy. It’s no Jurassic Park, but it’s no The Rise of Skywalker either."
Most of this movie feels like Trevorrow pulling out a chart of every blockbuster from the last decade and attempting to incorporate some of their elements to give this story an excuse to exist.
"Gone are the days of awe and genuine spectacle, the only wonder I felt was wondering when this would put me out of my misery and end. What did Ian Malcolm say about the dino droppings in Jurassic Park? It’s relevant here too."
"Dominion is a Frankenstein of a tentpole franchise picture and, when delivered with this kind of poorly written, cheese-filled, jaggedly over-inflated direction—with frequently awful CGI to boot—it is everything wrong with franchise filmmaking today."
"‘…the second Jurassic World trilogy grinds to a halt, still making coin but beloved by no-one…"
"A dinosaur movie with no particular interest in dinosaurs. The majestic creatures serve mainly as nuisances, interrupting characters who are busy with other, semi-related stuff."
"Scattershot, chaotic, and driven by a plot that simply drops all the promise of the last film in favor of something else, “Jurassic World Dominion” is a thoroughly disappointing blockbuster in just about every respect."
"For a while it seems ‘Dominion’ wants to be the franchise’s ‘Mission: Impossible.’ Instead, it’s the anti–‘Top Gun: Maverick’."
"Despite the huge and well-deserving success of Steven Spielberg's triple Oscar-winning original a full 30 summers ago, 'Jurassic Park' has been slowly melting in the dark ever since. Maybe this alleged 'epic conclusion' finally will put a lid on it."
"Jurassic World Dominion is dumb without the fun, and that just makes me sad."
It's talking down to its audience. It's condescending and feels very much like a Jurassic Park Circus of the Stars.
"Honestly, it’s probably a bad sign that of all the players in this film, the dinosaurs are probably the ones one roots for the most."
"An abysmal waste of money, just like the last one."
"An unintentional video game movie, but not in a good way."
The franchise continues to devolve into the mushiest thing possible and ends up smelling like 'Free Willy'... [Full review in Spanish]
Either loveless mockeries of family or dinosaurs literal and figurative...
"Apart from indulging in major fan service, it serves no other purpose. Watch it for its visual appeal and for the sense of nostalgia it provides."
"Overly long and soullessly engineered, the latest sequel in the dinosaur franchise fails to heed all of the lessons of its predecessors."
"No matter how big the dinosaurs in the ‘Jurassic Park’ franchise get, they’ll always be in the shadow of the original."
"Colin Trevorrow has done something nearly as astonishing: In Jurassic World Dominion, he has made dinosaurs dull. This $165 million effects extravaganza is built atop a script worthy of a board game."
"The film's commentary on corporate greed comes across as particularly phoney, when you realise who's being greedy here: the studio."
I have the feeling I just wasted my time with these dinosaurs in the process of civilization. [Full review in Spanish]
"Moments where the movie forgot to take its ADHD meds aside, Jurassic World Dominion is fun summer popcorn, pure and simple. Come for the cast reunion, stay for the cast reunion with the dinosaurs."
"Arguably the worst entry in the series. After sitting through this sorry sequel, I'm ready for the Jurassic franchise to go the way of the real dinosaurs."
"Yet another overwrought, clunky, asinine and overlong sausage from Hollywood's sausage factory."
"Once a technological movie marvel, “Jurassic World Dominion” further consigns every this-raptor and that-asaurus as any other movie kaiju, cogs in just another loud, computer-generated creature feature."
"Filled with consistently great performers and Chris Pratt, maybe the most unexpected thing is how turgid and inert the whole cast is here. You can dress dinosaurs in shoddy CGI all you want, but how dare you make Dame Laura Dern seem awkward?!"
"It’s a fast-paced thrill ride, a movie with hard-charging prehistoric beasts. Dominion has little interest in giving you time to think about how silly the thing you just saw was; it will just throw something else at you."
This serviceable franchise finale is saved by the original trio of actors who made the original Jurassic Park memorable.
"Here’s the chaos reality: ‘Dominion’ is a crowded, convoluted movie experience."
[Its] lumbering plot puts the plod in diplodocus.
"Whatever cosmic fate befell the dinosaurs, it's hard to imagine their demise being worse than this latest -- and allegedly final -- chapter of the six-film Jurassic franchise."
"Overall, I just wish the story in Dominion was a bit better. It's a shame that it gets a bit messy and convoluted like many of these instalments do."
"No effort has been spared in making this one’s canvas bigger, but that doesn’t make the film necessarily better."
"We see our old friends, but there’s no nostalgia, no emotional connection. It’s as if you’re in a museum looking at a copy of someone you once knew, now cold and inert."
Riveting stuff this is not.
"The story hurtles forward so fast and the beasts are rendered so realistically that despite its 146-minute length, there’s hardly time to think about the cataclysms outside the theater’s doors."
Why do Jurassic Park sequels think we're here for the idiot humans and not the dinosaurs?
"Watching Jurassic World Dominion is like watching small children flit between all the objects in their toy boxes. If there's an order or reason for what they're doing, it's never obvious or coherent."
"The first half is a mess, but the last 70 minutes is wall-to-wall action, chases, gratuitous dinosaur chomping and well-staged thrills. Doesn't have the wit or dazzle of the first ""Jurassic Park,"" but which of the other sequels do?"
"Donning a threadbare ecological mantle, Jurassic World Dominion rambles for roughly two and half hours, alternating action sequences, exposition, and a trio of plot threads."
"Jurassic World Dominion is an awe-inspiring mess of a movie.... It’s 150-minutes of dinosaurs, both CGI and animatronic, that will thrill the kids."
"It’s okay to slurp up some mindless slop now and again, it just stings a little when the slop thinks of itself as filet mignon."
Formulaic and derivative. The ultimate unnecessary sequel.
The plot is full of holes big enough for a brontosaurus to breezily breech.
"If you’ve been waiting for a ""Jurassic Park"" movie that primarily focuses on human clones and giant bugs, you’re in luck!"
This is not a story that begged to be told or a saga that demanded a finale. It’s another dispiriting example of how Hollywood never leaves money on the table. It’s just a shame that so much talent is wasted in the process
"It ain't Shakespeare, it's Gigantasaurus! Although far afield of the original, the story and situations sort of reminded me of those animals-gone-wild films of old … they were always a bit hokey but they delivered the popcorn thrills. Dino has feathers!"
"While Dominion tries to prey upon our nostalgia for the original Jurassic Park, it ends up being more of a dino doo doo sized mess. There's a dopamine hit from the original trio returning, but sadly perhaps one is better off rewatching the original film."
It inspires the feeling of awe you might have felt when you first saw dinosaurs romp and stomp on screen way back when.
"There is a great nostalgia factor with the reunion of Laura Dern, Sam Neill, and Jeff Goldblum, but the excitement quickly fades fast, and all you’re left with is a big steaming pile of dino feces. It’s sad how far the franchise has fallen."
"So, life, uh, found a way to make 'Jurassic World Dominion' mildly entertaining."
"A soulless, cheap, and exploitative dino-sized disaster that detours so far into left field from what Steven Spielberg envisioned in 1993, it almost tarnishes the entire brand."
"It's fast-paced but bland, familiar but unrecognizable. The intelligence behind the eyes of the franchise is gone, and it's been dumbed-down to swim in the same gene pool as a ""Transformers"" movie (not a compliment)."
"'Jurassic World Dominion' has its moments, but the latest installment in the franchise squanders what should have been a slam dunk."
"No, Jurassic World Dominion is nowhere near the masterpiece that Jurassic Park is. But at this point, do we even expect that from this franchise?"
"Jurassic World Dominion suffers fully from Overstuffed Sequel Syndrome, not unlike Spider-Man 3 or The Rise of Skywalker."
"Despite some eye-popping, adrenaline-fueled action sequences, it's overall more familiar than fresh. The raptors and T-rexes are still as menacing as ever, but without the distinct sense of awe or wonder they once inspired."
"The filmmakers were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should."
"With Jurassic World: Dominion, it's clear: Colin Trevorrow is the worst thing that's happened to dinosaurs since that asteroid knocked them all into the past tense."
There’s no pretense that the well-known packaging of a franchise needs to serve as a Trojan horse for novel ideas or artistry.
"I never found myself invested in the story or its characters, although it was nice seeing the stars from the original return even if they've been left high and dry by the material."
"The kid in us knows that even in a pokey, predictable sequel like this one you still stick around for the scary parts with the stampeding dinosaurs. But the wonder and awe of the Spielberg original have gone pfft."
"It’s a soulless money grab far removed from the classic 1993 film that launched the dino craze. Add a short cameo by a muscled-up, grunting Vin Diesel, and “Dominion” could easily fit into the “The Fast and the Furious” universe."
"Yes, the movie franchise defined by dinosaurs has seemingly run out of ideas for what to do with them, demoting them to mini-boss fodder and shifting focus to genetically-engineered super-locusts who threaten to cause a global food shortage."
"What killed the dinosaurs? If Jurassic World: Dominion is any indication, they were all bored to death."
"This film is not about dinosaurs and barely addresses the plot it advertises in it's marketing. The stakes are barely there during the action, and ends with a dull conclusion leaving you wanting much more."
"Universal has promised this will be the final instalment. Somewhere in the gleaming robot eyes of the giganotosaurus, you see a desperate hope the humans mean it."
I thoroughly enjoyed Jurassic World Dominion.
"Just an overlong attempt to get one more bite at those box-office dollars, with a solemn evolutionary message at the end designed to kid us that we've seen something profound."
"Yes, the connections between plot threads is a little strained in places, but it mostly hangs together, and the components are fun."
"Once again, a major motion picture has exploited the undeniable power of nostalgia. And it’s a good thing the movie has that going for it, because there’s precious little else to get excited about."
"All of these narrative jigsaw pieces interlock into overwhelming boredom, frequent watch-watching. Jurassic World: Dominion amounts to a complete waste of time."
The only takeaway from “Jurassic World Dominion” is that the franchise is ready for extinction.
But the much bigger crime that Jurassic World Dominion commits is in (largely) abandoning the potential of [the fact that dinosaurs are now amongst us].
"The totality feels indifferently assembled, and the stalkings and chases and dino-battles are for the most part bereft of the life-and-death tension that every other franchise entry has managed to summon."
"At two hours and twenty-six minutes, this is as hefty as the ginormous terrestrial behemoths that feature prominently in it, and it is just as ungainly"
"Gone is the sense of wonder that began 29 years ago, what’s left is doldrums & dread of seeing a once-fascinating story become so insipid. At nearly 2.5 hours long, it way overstays its welcome. Actually, it never has much reason to exist to begin with."
Maybe we deserve this.
"Here is a nearly non-stop, sci-fi action flick that is on prehistoric overload."
"No matter how effective the action is in the moment here – and again, the scenes are well staged throughout – with the dinosaurs as little more than props, there’s no life in Jurassic World: Dominion."
"Laura Dern getting equal screentime is great and the nostalgic elements are hit or miss, but an uninspired script leaves much to be desired."
"""Jurassic World Dominion"" sets its dinosaurs loose on the world, but then devotes more time to clone wars than monster mayhem."
A movie bankrupt of ideas.
Jurassic World Dominion is so beholden to what came before that it forces awkward references and reverence that bog down any new aspects from truly flourishing.
"It’s fun to see dinosaurs in snow and ice, rather than the tropics, and there are moments of real warmth and humor, as well as genuine pathos. It’s just never all that memorable. Rinse and repeat."
"Rather than feeling inspired by Spielberg, Jurassic World Dominion comes off as a hollow, cynical facsimile."
"Unfortunately, the excessive, yet impressive special effects of the dinosaurs and action in this film overshadow this never-ending, weak script. Even though your favorite characters from this franchise are back, it’s still all about the dinosaurs."
"""Jurassic World Dominion"" is all about one chase after another, most of which trample each other, never reach satisfying conclusions, and bury the old wonder deeper than the fossils themselves."
That sound you hear is a giganotosaurus yawning.
"They don't know what to do with these stories anymore. There are great moments in Jurassic World Dominion, but it never adds up as a whole."
"A blockbuster without grace, passion, or a sense of wonder. 
[Full review in Spanish]"
"There are plenty of films that require us to turn our brains off in order to enjoy them, but Jurassic World: Dominion requires much more. It’s not enough for your brain to be off; you have to be brain dead."
"Watching Jurassic World: Dominion, you might find yourself starting to feel just a little sorry for the people who made Jurassic World: Dominion."
"When everyone finally gets together, nothing happens! It's as if they were just casually gathering to take a selfie!"
"As much a genetic duplicate of its predecessors as the critters that run rampant in it are of their ancestors, and its frenetic pacing is likely to exhaust even the most rabid fans of the franchise, especially given an unconscionably long running-time."
"A fiendishly choreographed battle for survival that successfully suspends all your critical faculties, ending the franchise on a giddy high -- if it is the end. I suspect not. Where movie dinosaurs are concerned, never say die."
"It may be damning with faint praise to say that Jurassic World Dominion is the best of the Jurassic World trilogy, but at least it seems like they put in the extra effort toward telling a comprehensible story."
"'Dominion' cannot be said to be much worse than its predecessors. Yes, the seams are more visible because their characters are exhausted. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"The script is formulaic, the editing frenetic and only Goldblum rises above the tide of mediocrity, conjuring wit and charm out of thin air."
A forgettable monster movie that lost anything that made it special in the first place.
"If Jurassic World signaled the return of the franchise, “Dominion” signals its demise. It’s really time to close the park for good and move on. There’s nothing to see here anymore."
Enjoy Jurassic World: Dominion for what it is -- a popcorn movie that lets you forget the world for 156 minutes.
"It's not THAT bad. While Dominion is the weakest of the World Trilogy, it's still better than Park 2 & 3. Great to see so many of the original actors again. The first act is not good but once it gets back to the classic Jurassic formula, a lot of fun!"
"Histrionics, heavy breathing ... and all the paleo-pandemonium one can stomach."
A fate worse than extinction has cruelly visited the cloned dinosaurs that have been roaming on silver screens since 1993: They’ve become mundane. A nuisance. The kind of pests you might call your local wildlife department about.
Brings back likable characters and has the good grace to move at a fast clip.
"If 100 Tyrannosaurus rexes were put into a room with 100 typewriters, pounding away with their adorable tiny claws, they would likely produce something of greater value than the witless bombast of “Jurassic World Dominion.”"
It is a criminal offense that the director can't generate a tense or suspenseful moment that doesn't involve recycling something that has already been done before in this franchise. [Full review in Spanish]
There’s no magic. There’s no heart. There’s no suspense.
It’s heavy-handed when I just wanted to see a movie about dinosaurs eating people. And about that. There are not enough scenes of dinosaurs eating people. There are 7 different movies in Jurassic World: Dominion and none of them belong in the same plot.
"If I had watched this movie at the age at which I saw the original, I would have left the theater in tears. I can't imagine the kind of person who would derive pleasure from any of it, and I would not want to meet them."
"t’s a movie that preys on nostalgia like a velociraptor preys on white men with too much confidence. And yes, that’s a good thing."
"While Jurassic World Dominion still has its dopy moments and feels more like an amusement-park ride than a movie sometimes, it’s still exciting to watch dinosaurs do their respective things."
"The movie has its moments, and the CGI really is fabulous, but this go-round feels fairly tired. It’s also too long, and much of it is paced in a somewhat... leisurely?... fashion."
"Marvel, and latterly Bond, showed for a while that franchise cinema can be intricate, emotional and daring. Jurassic Park was, though, quickly stretched thin, and unravels altogether here."
"Fans of the signature creature-feature sentiments can look forward to some moments of special effects laden narrative, but this is a far cry from the wonder and magic generated in the first adaptation of Michael Crichton’s novel."
"When you come right down to it, “Jurassic World: Dominion,” could have been a whole lot better, but I get the feeling that the filmmakers just do not care. Otherwise, we would have had a better story for the series swan song."
"If something defines this delivery, it is the search for redemption..The film is lived, consequently, as a great act of reconciliation.

"Its tired characters, abundant clichés and contrived plot amount to a feast of unearned emotion."
"It felt predictable, bloated and boring most of the time."
What’s nowhere to be found in this film are the magic and childlike wonder of seeing dinosaurs on the big screen.
"At two hours and 26 minutes, the behemoth is the heftiest in the 29-year-old series. But size doesn’t matter — “Dominion” is also the worst."
"It's almost laughably bad, but that would make it more entertaining. Sadly, it's just a dull dino drama."
"Taking the franchise back to its roots was a great idea. The film went a little too deep in the nostalgia box overall, but it is a high-energy, fun, final chapter."
Jurassic World: Dominion ... takes a series that seemed out of worthwhile ideas and runs merely on the fumes of an idea.
"Did I mention the locusts? Because I’m here to see dinosaurs, not bugs that are a bit larger than they ought to be."
"Stuck in its own nostalgia loop, it doesn't break new ground as much as retread it. And CGI dinos just don't feel as awesome anymore."
"There’s lots of action, sure, but the latest installment of this ongoing dinosaur-run-amok sci-fi saga requires hefty suspension of disbelief to follow."
Jurassic World Dominion satisfies fans who come for Dino fights and nostalgia while leaving the rest of the audience a little cold.
"A talky dino-bore. Near the beginning of the film Dern’s character Ellie sees a small dinosaur and coos, “this never gets old.” She clearly hasn’t seen Jurassic World Dominion."
"The first two instalments of the Jurassic World trilogy seemed to have that spark of electricity, breathing life back into our fantasy dino world but Dominion has shorted that fuse and that sizzle has been reduced to world-ending unoriginal fizzle."
The film seems hellbent on demonstrating just how out of gas it is.
"Preposterous but entertaining, Jurassic World: Dominion not only finds new ways to inspire the awe and wonder sorely lacking from previous installments, it recaptures some of that Spielberg magic."
"But it’s when the dinosaurs aren’t snarling and snapping, and the equally impressive great clouds of giant locusts have disappeared over the horizon, that we’re left with the humans in “JWD” and they are not nearly as compelling."
Jurassic World: Dominion teams nostalgic moments and some thrilling new dinosaurs to put an emotional end to the much-loved franchise.
"What is disappointing is that for all the trumpeting about it being the finale of three decades' worth of storytelling, Jurassic World: Dominion never ends up being that impactful."
"Instead of a fitting swansong to a successful franchise, it becomes a creative misfire."
"Admittedly, the story here is pretty thin, but let’s face it, fans don’t go to see these films for the scintillating dialogue. They go because the visual effects --- the dinosaurs --- are AMAZING."
Enough is enough.
"If you want to see dinosaurs, at least you’ll enjoy that. Prehistoric creatures doing their thing are the best part of Jurassic World: Dominion."
There’s a good hour-and-a-half adventure movie buried in this two-and-a-half-hour adventure movie.
It brings me no pleasure to say that this is the worst yet. The magic is gone and what this feels like is an attempt for director Colin Trevorrow to put a broken egg back together.
A bloated 2½ hour plod that is unforgivably dull and irreconcilably misjudged.
"Wait a few months for the Jeff Goldblum compilations to come out, and you’ll have seen all the good parts of this film."
"… while it’s not particularly good, it manages to be pretty entertaining for the most part."
"A bitter disappointment because, while it brings the dinosaurs, it fails to tell a solid story."
"There’s an awful lot going on in “Dominion” and it all looks the same. The far too numerous action sequences blur together, nearly all of them indistinguishable from the other, many of them failing to advance the plot in any meaningful way."
Viewers will find enough to keep their attention. Just don’t expect the experience to last much beyond the end credits or hold up under scrutiny.
"It's difficult to describe just how exasperating it was to watch Jurassic World Dominion. It's not so much because I expected greatness, but because there's simply so much talent present here that it's devastating to watch it all go to waste."
Dern and Howard kind of took over the film. Howard has suddenly become an action star. She’s radiant. Dern is very much the authority figure. Neill is like a patient great uncle who can’t wait to leave.
"An insecure movie that is awkwardly searching for approval from the audience and from Spielberg, one of the film’s executive producers."
A shameful triumph of corporate greed.
Something that was particularly exciting for this reviewer was the way this movie connected to the original Jurassic Park—both film and novel—in unexpected ways.
"The point of entertainment is not to wear you down, but you’d never know it from watching Jurassic World Dominion, directed by Colin Trevorrow."
"“Jurassic World? Not a fan,” Ian says, as if to beat the audience from saying the same thing about this movie."
"This is not so much a movie as sending-off party in which everyone has been invited, even people who do not matter that much, and no one can remember the theme."
"If director and co-writer Colin Trevorrow and company’s scripting and pacing feels a little all over the shop, there are plenty of breathtaking and crowd pleasing sequences and more than a few memorable moments and inventive shots."
Dominion leans into the notion of a sci-fi dystopia doubling as an old-fashioned monster movie...
Any given audience member’s appreciation for Jurassic World Dominion will likely vary inversely to the degree they prefer their cloned dinosaur movies to take things seriously.
"Much like Fallen Kingdom, Dominion never feels remotely organic to what the original films suggested; cloning and creating dinosaurs? Sure! The same treatment for humans? Now you’ve gone too far!"
... a retread of all that has gone before...  reducing dinosaurs to essentially zombie hordes... shipping characters where it can and offering fan service in place of originality... the central plot remains status quo.
Alan and Ellie's budding romance comes off like unnecessary fan service that distracts from what JURASSIC devotees are really here to see.
"Jurassic World Dominion ticks a few boxes but not quite enough to make this a distinctive, original, memorable adventure."
"An enthralling, brilliantly made, balls-to-the-wall, mega-sized Bronto-burger of mass-market entertainment...Another sterling exemplar from Hollywood about how to do sequels properly...VFX connoisseurs will get joyously drunk on the offerings here."
"Bloated and with a scatterbrained plot, Jurassic World Dominion is a disappointing, overstuffed mess with too many awkward jokes and not enough dinosaur action."
"After 'Jurassic World Dominion,' we might just be racing toward the extinction of the Jurassic Park franchise."
"The only joy in this movie comes from its precise mimicry. It has no identity of its own, which becomes depressingly apparent when the franchise’s old and new characters finally come face to face."
"Jurassic World: Dominion throws everything at the summer movie wall, hoping enough sticks to make you have a good time. Plenty doesn't work here, but just enough does to warrant a very mild recommendation for some."
"Jurassic World: Dominion has a terrible script but achieves thrilling, CGI-fueled action. My issues are mitigated by pure entertainment value. Who doesn't enjoy watching a Pterosaur rip a plane out of the sky?"
"Jurassic World Dominion is a good crowd-pleaser that is a great capper on the whole of the franchise so far. Of course, they could end it here…but they probably won’t."
"Undeniably entertaining and will frequently have you on the edge of your seat, but like previous Jurassic World films it likely won’t leave an impression solid enough to be preserved in amber."
"In an almost impressive display of ineptitude, Dominion combines the very worst vices of its predecessors in addition to a few new ones for good measure."
The supermarket sweep approach to blockbuster filmmaking reaches its horrible apotheosis — Jurassic World: Fast and Furiosaurus.
It evokes less the splendor of '90s era Jurassic Park than it does the excess of '90s summer catastrophes like Wild Wild West or 1998's Godzilla.
