review
Jordan Peele’s third film captures the terrible beauty of our endless fascination with events no matter how horrific.
"Nope, Peele’s third directorial outing, may debut in the horror genre, but there’s more to the brilliant film than audiences’ expectations."
More stylish than substantial.
"I love all of Jordan's movies so far, but this one might be my favorite just because there's so much to unpack. Every time I think about it I find more things that I need to talk about and it's the gift that keeps giving."
"It's a very layered movie, lot of themes on Hollywood and how it uses people and kinda chews them up and spits them out - figuratively.  He [Jordan Peele] is probably one of our best directors today."
The failure of Nope is partly because of Peele's lack of restraint in terms of mangling together mismatched ideas.
"Although the vision is stronger than the pen this time around, the Spielberg-esque scope is all-embracing, and his craftiness in the individual horror/sci-fi set pieces is utterly remarkable."
"As with his previous films, Peele wears his inspirations on his sleeve. This time around he mines heavily from two Spielberg classics, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Jaws."
"Jordan Peele takes full advantage of Hoyte van Hoytema's phenomenal cinematography and Michael Abels' memorable score to create a spectacle worthy of the big screen, but it's the sound production that really elevates the movie to that level."
An almost perfect spectacle that dives into our obsessions with spectacles in our real life. A unique blockbuster that will make you afraid of looking up.
Jordan Peele has made a science fiction thriller that is one of the most visually striking films in recent memory.
"Known for his powerful social commentary in US and Get Out, Jordan Peele reinvents the summer blockbuster through a neo-sci-fi western that looks at society’s obsession with spectacle."
"Damn the white-washed history, and the capitalist traps of Hollywood’s fortune and fame. The beast has no more power here."
"It's a good movie, but perhaps it's time to take some of our bloated expectations off Peele as a filmmaker."
The film ultimately spends what feels like an eternity in a climactic and rather confusing confrontation that feels elaborate but fails to ratchet up the tension.
A sci-fi horror flick that raises some interesting questions about why aliens might come to Earth and what for.
Director-writer Peele clearly knows the business of suspending disbelief. I say “yup” to ‘Nope.’
Beneath the interesting and strange tale of aliens and UAPs is Peele shining a bright light from the sky onto Hollywood and American pop culture’s exploitation of Black people and animals.
There's so much considered detail and nuance that is weaved into these fantastical themes which is bolstered by a lot of the characters taking control of their own narrative.
I've never felt that before. It was a completely new feeling especially in the sci-fi horror genre where you just don't get a lot of Black happiness and Black people and Black camaraderie.
Yup.
This final confrontation is truly a spectacle...
Don't look up
Feels like a modern take on a classic sci-fi story that would have made a really fantastic episode of The Twilight Zone.
Jordan Peele's Nope innovatively uses the IMAX format in ways many wouldn't have believed possible to create an inescapably immersive experience.
"To say I was horrified isn’t quite the right word, but Nope gave me that queasy, funny feeling only Peele knows how to create."
"There are few experiences more thrilling in cinema these days than watching a Jordan Peele film, and Nope is without question his biggest effort so far in terms of scale and spectacle."
"Nope continues Peele’s winning streak of smart, surprising, and hugely effective thrillers."
"NOPE has ground breaking cinematography and sound design. If seen in theaters or under surround sound, you truly feel like something is out there. Palmer and Kaluuya have great performances, but it was Steve Yeun's character that was most engaging here"
"Nope establishes Jordan Peele as an auteur, with a unique perspective in telling stories cinematically! Don’t worry folks, if you think you saw the movie in the final trailers, you don’t know what you’re in for."
"Brandon Perea quickly became one of our favorite new performances of the year thanks to his fantastic comedic timing in Nope...five stars, Angel, five stars."
"It's a spectacle about spectacle, and about the gambles we'll take to create it and monetize it. That quest lies at the heart of American culture. Nope suggests it's a quest that might eat us all alive."
Beautiful and terrifying.
"This is a film full of symbolic exhortations, which is as much a part of the goals of science-fiction as it is essential to Peele’s cinematic oeuvre."
"If you’re expecting another Get Out or Us, you’ll be sorely disappointed. But if given the chance to enjoy it for what it is, then you’ll be saying Nope is dope! That’s a huge yep from me."
"Closer to the slick visuals of “Get Out” but with a more probing narrative, akin to “Us,” “Nope” is as much an experience as all of Peele’s efforts, with a similarly intriguing premise."
"“Nope” is another equally thrilling and smart ride from the rising director, subtly tackling intersecting ideas about “seeing” and “being seen” along the way."
"... layering text and subtext so that audiences can choose to engage with either, deriving pleasure from the tale as either a cinematic spectacle or a profound exploration of humanity’s inability ..."
Jordan Peel's latest is ambitious and well-made but exhausting and confusing. It's a film full of ideas but it's also stuck in neutral.
The first hour of Nope is pretty negligible fare with the exception of a flashback to a killer chimpanzee and the wonderful-to-see-again Donna Mills almost getting kicked in the kisser by an upset steed.
"Nope is full of fun, freaky, thoughtful re-imaginings of the classic UFO movie loaded with creepy monsters, silly characters, and high-stakes action sequences."
"The odd pacing and ofttimes disjointed storytelling will be off-putting to some, but they're in the service of a variety of knotty themes."
"It's a comment on Hollywood and how people are wasted, swallowed up, disfigured in the name of entertainment. But it’s also foreboding and spooky as hell."
"…a good Saturday night entertainment, but perhaps more was expected from a writer director whose name has become an established brand…"
"Peele puts the logic-defying risks people take to ""capture the moment"" and feed society’s obsession the mysterious front and center. It’s dark, twisted and tilts at windmills full throttle."
"Peele has emerged as one of the great living filmmakers by marrying the genre conventions of science fiction and horror with deep, layered social commentary."
"[Nope] takes this word as its title and offers several other interesting usages. All of them suggest that what we’re thinking or saying is absurdly wrong: a proposition that doesn’t need to be made, or that can’t be responded to in any other way."
"Instead of trying to elucidate the plot, it is better to let ourselves be distracted by the images with their allegories and symbolism alluding to Hollywood, and racial and social differences. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Working with the fine cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, Peele turns the Haywood ranch into a wide-format proscenium of supernatural mayhem."
"I thought that this was like a well told story, it kept me hooked and engaged all the way to the end."
"I got the same rush/thrill watching NOPE that I did watching ""War of the Worlds""... I found NOPE to be pretty chilling."
"Peele’s direction remains thought provoking whilst utilising jump scares, close framing and the audience’s fear of the unknown to amplify that sensation of unease."
"Far from perfect, but with more interesting visuals and themes.  [Full review in Spanish]"
My best guess is that Nope is an allegory about what happens when we try to profit from forces we barely understand.
"Acclaimed horror filmmaker Jordan Peele's latest film Nope is an attempt at addressing our obsession with spectacle and this insatiable desire to look, rather than look away."
"The first act of Nope is strange, scary, and even a little weird [but] the intrigue doesn't last."
"Despite [Jordan] Peele’s masterful direction in the IMAX-worthy technical areas, he sadly failed what equally matters as well — engaging character arcs and storytelling."
"Here’s the thing. I never got a sense of what Peele wanted this film to be, outside of mildly shocking and thrilling. The worst thing a film critic can leave a theater with is confusion over what the package delivered was supposed to mean or infer."
Nope’s staging is more naturalistic. Peele trusts his overwhelmed characters to forge a path through the story’s obstacles and frights without obvious metacommentary.
"It's really excellently put together at about every level, which is what I've come to expect from Jordan Peele at this point, and he didn't disappoint."
"Despite some ingenious touches and a nod or two to the history of movie-making, Peele’s third movie is an incoherent, chaotic disappointment."
"A film that mixes elements of horror movies, with science fiction and even suspense, to develop an unpredictable story with touches of dark humor. Full review in Spanish."
Peele's close encounter of the third kind at times lacks tension or something that hypnotize. [Full review in Spanish]
"Nope is a movie about aliens in which fear comes too late, and collective survival is not a priority. That self-absorption is the allegory of the times. [Ful. review in Spanish]"
"A tense, gory and unsettling thrill-ride, it’s also wittily restrained, with something weirdly satisfying about the characters sparingly finally uttering the titular “Nope!” in moments of extreme peril."
"Peele’s terrific third feature, “Nope,” pairs old fashioned Hollywood showmanship with the director’s trademark blend of humor and dread, crafting a 1970s-style, thinking-viewer’s blockbuster with more spectacle than any contemporary Disney production."
"Despite the characters lacking a certain psychological depth, Nope has some interesting reflections about its production context and its dynamic pacing makes it entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]"
Peele brings together ingredients of fantasy and terror that are pertinent to initiate reflection on more than one issue.  [Full review in Spanish]
"A loaded thriller that doesn't reach, nor does it want to, the classic dramatic tension of a horror film. [Full review in Spanish]"
Yesterday's cinema allies with today's in order to help the hero capture the impossible. [Full review in Spanish]
"Like an amusement park—and of course, there is one in the story—the actors join Peele in putting on a bedazzling show."
"Another Jordan Peele slow burn, and you sometimes wish it would hurry up a little."
"Nope plays with the human need for spectacle, not only the human need to witness a tragedy without feeling threatened, but also the need to be seen.  [Full review in Spanish]"
"Not only are the characters throughout the film guilty of the sin of gawking at and exploiting—rather than respecting—creatures and humans alike, but the film’s audience must consider their own posture. Do we find pleasure in the horrors we watch?"
"There are delicious popcorn-movie vibes and horrors galore, both funny-suspenseful and stone-cold bone-chilling. But most intriguing is the twistiness of how the movie grapples with its own existence."
"There’s obviously a lot of ideas going on, references, all that jazz, but it’s a frustrating experience, a film of diminishing interest as it plods along."
"Peele arbitrarily intermixes obsessions, questions, influences and his thesis, so much that we lose our compass and get lost in understanding the eye of the story. [Full review in Spanish]"
"... A story that runs out of steam. Oh, and also, long. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Writer-director Jordan Peele simultaneously heightens the audience’s anticipation to a feverish pitch while also mocking it. The addiction to spectacle will kill us all, we’ll just be too busy livestreaming it to care."
A fun experience that uses imagination to challenge and overcome its lack of narrative depth. [Full review in Spanish]
"Even Steven Spielberg would have to admit, “Nope” is one of the best close encounters we’ve had with aliens. Jordan Peele’s suggestions make sense. Best of all, they entertain thoroughly."
An immersive voyeuristic thriller that explores survival in the broader sense.
"Jordan Peele's sci-fi horror is mostly a ""yup."""
"... Peele -- aesthete, showman, and limitless auteur -- immerses us in a disquieting film that at times entertains us, at others, it terrifies us but always fascinates us. [Full review in Spanish]"
"... The most exciting piece of film-making you've seen all year: stealthy, ambiguous and constantly teetering on the edge of the iconic."
"There is a lot happening in this film, more than enough to warrant repeated viewings..."
"Perhaps as cryptic [as Us] but it concludes more convincingly, without having to be exaggeratedly explosive. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Peele’s biggest spectacle yet, featuring stunning visuals around an incredibly talented cast...[h]owever, unlike Peele’s first two films, the social commentary and symbolism embedded in Nope sometimes overshadow the overall plot"
"Nope absolutely brilliant. A subversive look at the horror genre, masterfully weaving in social commentary and packed with strong allegories among characters and themes. 
Jordan Peele continues to flex his filmmaking skills as one of the best directors."
'Nope' is an exhilarating experience that should not be missed by sci-fi or horror fans.
"With its unique style, Nope may not end up being everybody's cup of tea, but it's an indicator of a filmmaker who is a master in storytelling."
"Ever since cinema has existed, we've always been in pursuit of spectacle, [and I love] the way that manifests across all these different characters."
An out-of-the-box scary movie that deconstructs the summer blockbuster with its daring cross-genre and referential cinema. [Full review in Spanish]
"It's extremely sophisticated, this film. And it's very mysterious in its structure."
Peele expects us to react to disturbing energetic fields and intermittent power outages that never cause uneasiness. More audacity was expected from him. Do I recommend it? The answer is in the title.
"Brimming with tension but laced with gaiety so as to never feel hostile, Nope is an operatic and sweeping thriller that celebrates cinema and simultaneously condemns it as an industry built on obscured violence."
"Jordan Peele continues to astound, mixing his genres but continuing to amplify his own unique voice. This latest film is his most Hollywood while not being Hollywood at all."
It is always exciting when Jordan Peele releases a new movie -- you never know which one of his anxieties he will put on the big screen or which classic movies the film buff will reference and remix.
"The result is overwhelming, electrifying and very refreshing, perfect for summer.  [Full review in Spanish]"
Nope plays with various elements and we have to connect them in order to have a truly fascinating experience. [Full review in Spanish]
"Peele's third outing is ambitious but unfocused. It's by far his best looking film and has a fun and suspenseful tone throughout. Unfortunately, his metaphors and symbolism seem, at time, to take priority over story and coherence."
Jordan Peele is 3 for 3!
"""[Jordan Peele] has to get back to being focused and letting us in on what he has to say."""
"Nope wears Peele’s typically theme-conscious writing lightly, sprinkling it here and there amid its creature-feature horror in a way that might only dawn on you in the aftermath."
"The result is disarming, terrifying and exhilarating, anchored in quirkily complex characters and, as the title suggests, a general sense of disbelief."
"Meanings in Nope spring eternal, and they are surely too numerous to be absorbed in one go. A repeat viewing, then? I wouldn’t say nope."
"Nope may be one of the best acted horror films since, well, Get Out. A popcorn movie with a brain, Nope shows Peele has an ability to hold a mirror up to society while still being thoroughly entertaining."
"A gorgeously shot, if somewhat self-indulgent, saga of spectacle."
"It's an exhilarating and fun ride as a result. Maybe more superficial than you'd expect from a Peele film, but no less complex in its characterizations."
"Emerging into a culture that has always ""had skin in the game"", Jordan Peele's third movie Nope has plenty to say about Black creativity within Hollywood."
"The social commentary is necessary and biting, addressing norms and ideas that have long been ignored by mainstream media and entertainment. Peele is a master in his storytelling and Nope is just one more example of his storytelling prowess."
"Profoundly Herzogian in what it makes out of the film, the hallucinated odyssey, a unique quest... to capture in celluloid that strange unidentified flying object. Or identified: the white screen where dreams live called cinema. [Full review in Spanish]"
"While you can’t help but recognize (and enjoy) the influences of Hitchcock, Carpenter, and Spielberg, Peele’s efforts to put his own stamp on the movie comes at the expense of character development, narrative cohesion, and story momentum."
"Jordan Peele returns to form with his glorious, awe-inspiring third film"
"The sound design is inventive and slippery, always evocative, and Michael Abels’ score provides by turns, both bombast and insinuating grace."
A better movie to argue about than to watch.
"It did not disappoint. The film mixes Sci-fi, Horror, and Western elements into one unique package. I loved it and have spent the days since I saw it going over it in my mind repeatedly."
"As far as film theory goes, it’s hardly revolutionary, but as science fiction, Nope is smart and entertaining as we’ve come to expect from an increasingly captivating filmmaker."
"This is Peele’s most ambitious movie, and he completely nails it. It’s Jaws for the 21st Century. It’s a masterpiece of horror and science fiction, and it has one of the best third acts I've ever seen."
"... Bites off more than it can chew, [Nope is] doubtlessly the lesser film in [Peele's] filmography though his creativity is always much needed in today's cinema landscape. [Full review in Spanish]"
There’s plenty to admire in Nope but the overall delivery felt convoluted and disjointed - it threatened to be great but never really got close.
"A reach-for-the-skies masterpiece that's ambitious and eerie, imaginative and expertly crafted, as savvy about cinema as it is about spectacle, and inspires the exact opposite term to its moniker."
"A solid, weird sci-fi thriller with horses and balloons."
"[Peele] may never again make a film so elegantly structured as Get Out (who has?), but the ferment of interlocking ideas here is so diverting it hardly matters that the film is more at home to a meander than steady ascent."
"It’s a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma, but it never quite unlocks its own internal logic. As summer blockbusters go, that’s more than enough."
More a nope than a yep...
"The script’s sharp humour, visual gags and expert line delivery provide hilarious moments of relief to the horrifying tension of this overarching predatory threat."
"Imagine a cocktail, so full of ingredients that you can't taste any of them properly. That sums up the muddled narrative of this film."
Peele is very good at building suspense and you are constantly wondering where the story is heading.
Everything about Nope is best when it sucks you in by surprise and swallows you whole.
Nope is nothing if not a spectacle. Peele wants you to look and he wants you to think about the exercise of looking and consuming – and he has all the tricks to hypnotise and bewitch his audiences so they never look away.
The toy box is bigger but the cautionary themes run true to form in writer-director Jordan Peele’s alien misadventure.
"<I>Nope</I> is scary, funny, disturbing and sharp. But above all, it's expertly crafted spectacle."
"Peele's layering of themes and ideas, which don't always cohere but form a multifaceted and thought-provoking critique, takes second place to a popcorn thrill ride of high stakes and bruising action."
"Nope is an ambitious, vibrant, mix of genres and influences which, for the most part, is thrilling to experience even when it doesn't hit the mark."
"What follows isn’t some didactic message movie, though, but a sly revolt against the oppressiveness of that history."
"There’s nothing wrong with taking chances, but this effort plays as if [Jordan Peele] made a list of some of his favourite preoccupations and set about trying to paste them together with nothing stronger than unadulterated optimism."
"Flaws and all, the beauty of Nope is being two things at once. Art and cheap thrills, popcorn and provocation, blockbuster and brainfood: the old, mixed-up formula that is still cinema’s secret weapon."
At times one feels as though Peele’s film is trying to do too many things all at once yet barely succeeding at making the points it seeks to make.
"Nope has a lot going on, but the magic comes from the way the elements work together. There are plenty of surprises here, but they’re not always the surprises you might expect."
OJ and Em find imaginative and practical ways to get themselves out of trouble. That’s why the audience goes along with them for the ride. They’re willing to let go of trauma the way children let go of helium-filled balloons.
"Nope is a film of many ideas, competing for primacy in a script that somehow dodges being muddled -- and instead hits the screen as a cohesive and engrossing mosaic."
"The more I thought about it, the less sense it made, but sometimes, in such wild and poetic endeavours as this, thought is the enemy."
"Peele, really, is the magician disguised as a filmmaker. Nope is the sleight of hand so slick you’ll never question how the trick was pulled off."
"What’s a bad miracle, and how far will you go to ignore a potential backfire? Peele’s Nope stands more as a love letter to the cinema that raised us, scared us, and implored us to grasp impossibilities."
"What is plopped before us is a painfully slow, mind-numbingly dull film with so many story holes and lapses in logic one has to wonder whether any member of Peele's team had the stones to tell him when things in his turgid tale just weren't making sense."
… a grand and fascinating spectacle for those who can attune to its wild and heady rhythms.
"Its big reveal is the best kind: one that seems obvious in hindsight, but delivers a wonderful kind of cinematic pleasure, that of seeing a unique idea presented on screen for the very first time."
"It’s a fascinating, unique and utterly original work, enlivened by some wonderful performances. ... The result is one of the great studio movies this year."
"This is big, compelling cinema that Peele expertly weaves blockbuster mentality and grounded terror together, refusing to sacrifice his unique vision in the process.  Cliché to say, but it’s a resounding ‘Yep’ here."
"Similar to how the series Moon Haven and the film Lightyear give us a space that is inclusive and diverse, Nope reminds us that POC runs deep in every part of this country."
"""While I do think Jordan Peele made a misstep by choosing message over narrative, after sitting with the film for awhile the message does make the movie a lot more interesting and entertaining."" - Myke C. Town"
"Brilliantly executed and entertaining...it's a hat-trick for Jordan Peele, the modern master of suspense."
Yup.
"Nevertheless, Nope is an underwhelming film that’s still a fascinating addition to Peele’s filmography and proves him to be a versatile master of the cinematic arts."
"The violence of attention is a key concern here, likewise the idea that our biggest threats could be hiding in plain sight, but it’s worth noting that Nope also functions as a thrilling summer blockbuster in its own right too."
"I enjoyed the dialogue, symbolism and themes of this film. I'm still a bit mixed on Keke Palmer but I did enjoy her in this role."
I thought the two leads brought their A-game and Jordan Peele has cemented himself as one of the most interesting talents creating original stories.
"It is a silly, nonsensical story filled with crazy characters, but it is fun, for the most part. The characters are worth watching and the story is compelling in its own way, the killer chimp subplot excepted."
"With the release of his third feature, Nope, Jordan Peele has solidified his reputation for making ambitious, interesting thrillers that mystify enormous audiences."
It keeps you interested until it lets you down. Lots of potential but little pay off.
"Whilst Nope nods to - and borrows from - other well-known ‘alien invasion’ films, as well as pop-culture horror, it also manages to be its own unique film, with genuinely impressive twists and well-timed comedy."
"Jordan Peele effortlessly weaves a tapestry of horrific imagery and intense moments of threat, making Nope a very uncomfortable, but thoroughly enjoyable, roller-coaster ride."
"Like all of Peele’s movies, you feel like you need to go back and rewatch it to catch everything and formulate your theories, a fun exercise that rekindles our joy for cinema -- the positive side of Hollywood spectacle."
"[C]reepy and charming, fearful and funny – a mélange of vibes that probably shouldn’t work as well as it does. Another excellent production from the mind of a generational talent. Say yes to “Nope.”"
"In the end, Peele doesn't illuminate those themes so much as he subsumes them in traditional Hollywood action beats... Still, a failure from him is more compelling than a success from most other filmmakers."
"More thriller than horror, with a twisted story that has deeper meaning if you look hard enough, but still a fun watch for those who don’t want to."
"Peele wants to entertain as much as provoke, and he's not playing subtle. Nope is bold, in-your-face, and holds nothing back but most of all, is too much fun."
"Jordan Peele is no longer Raffi Benitez to me.  Now when I hear his name I think about the cinema’s new master of suspense.  If I met him, I’d shake his hand…and “Slap Ass!”"
Nope is still too fun and has too many effective sequences to be considered a disappointment. It's just not as resoundingly impressive as we've come to expect from Peele.
"Writer-director Jordan Peele’s mysterious third film, Nope, draws on genre tropes from both alien invasion films and Westerns, but it ends up with something altogether original: a Hollywood spectacle about spectacle."
"""Nope"" is a funny, yet, terrifying sci-fi that will have you laughing while jumping out of your seat."
"Hunting for hidden meaning within the story and the pictures deepens the complexity of our relationship with the movie, but that's also a distraction from the simple enjoyment of its popcorn flick simplicity."
"Strong acting and immersive set pieces elevate its first half, but the weight of a disjointed script ends up sinking NOPE's gigantic potential."
"Nope is fantastic! Includes great performances, immersive sound and amazing cinematography. A thought-provoking ride with shades of Spielberg, Hitchcock and Shyamalan. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The cast is a blast and they carry the film– Kaluuya and Palmer in particular are a sparking set of contrasts, glowering toast-dry cool and pixie-ish chili-pepper hot."
So many ideas crammed into one film and somehow it doesn't add up to a satisfying cohesive experience in the end. Incredible cinematography and a strong setup that doesn't seem to resonate as strongly as Peele's other work.
"""Nope” is incoherently told. It’s a fascinating mess of a movie, almost never predictable in its messy nature, but devoid of the discipline needed to truly grab our attention."
Jordan Peele’s ambitious project combines horror tropes with western vistas and wide-screen spectacle.
"Nope is a mirror that reflects back all the good, the bad, and the ugly of chasing after miracles right at us. No wonder all three of Peele's films so far have interchangeable titles."
"I kept wishing these actors were in a better movie, one that cared a bit more about crossing those t's and dotting those i's so you could spend more time enjoying their company and less time dwelling..."
"Whereas ‘Us’ had the feeling of a director straining to outdo his prior achievements, Jordan Peele’s third film strikes a perfect balance between inspiration and perspiration."
"What we've got here is nothing more or less than a director in full bloom, eyes wandering beyond the present toward both past and future."
"This is not Peele’s best work, but it is well made and has much of his familiar inventiveness and novel approach to horror, making it a film well worth watching."
"Aiming for fireworks, he’s fired off a dud—though following two home runs, one foul is allowed."
Peele rejects the premise that lies at the heart of the idea of the frontier: an unspoiled landscape that offers rugged and determined white men the opportunity to make their fortune.
“Nope” is an exuberant tribute to what would happen if all those “what ifs” about visitors from another planet actually happened right in the middle of the place where motion picture dreams are created.
"Does everything about Nope work? The answer is in the title but Peele's ambition, clear voice, and careful craftsmanship pay off in big movie-movie ways."
Both his most impressive work from a technical standpoint and his least ambitious in terms of social commentary and thematic examination.
"Peele’s exceptional script and direction, the story’s density, intelligence, and thrilling creativity are so strong the experience becomes visceral."
"Peele brings his comedic chops, palpable cinephilia, and an endlessly compatible cast together in a soft, often quiet tale that marks a clear development of his craft. Everyone will find something to appreciate about Nope."
"I'm here to tell you Nope is interesting. Its combination of appealing ingredients fails to come together in a meaningful form, but it's a nice change from the usual big screen stuff."
Nope is a well-made movie that will land differently with every viewer and have you looking at the skies a little differently.
"It may be over-stuffed with metaphors and symbolism, but it delivers it's central message with plenty of entertainment."
"For all that’s here, so much in Nope feels lost or undermined in the stew of many things Peele as an artist seems hungry and eager to do. But we’re lucky to have him, even when the fact stands as a liability: Peele really wants to do it all."
"For all its visually stunning and terrifying glory, Nope does have its flaws, coming off as overstuffed with ideas, yet ending as suddenly as it began. But Peele’s commitment to overstuffing, to truly going for it, should be commended whenever possible."
"""I don't think it's a horrible movie but I also don't think it's a great film. I think it's very interesting and whatever you take from it is what you take from it."" - Nicki Dusse"
"Between the watered-down storytelling, the hollow characters, and the frustrating lack of coherence between the interwoven stories, Nope is one summer blockbuster that can’t quite deliver."
"A new Jordan Peele film is always a reason to celebrate and while Nope will likely prove more polarizing than his previous efforts, the performances and spectacle alone are worth recommending the film."
"NOPE is a valiant effort to be sure, with amazing sound design and the highly underrated Michael Wincott. Keke Palmer is dazzling. But interesting and quirky characters can't make up for the sludgy pacing, which is quite brutal to get through."
Peele is riffing in imaginative ways that kept me engaged and eager to see what all the fuss was about.
"It’s a one-hundred-and-thirty-minute litany of “nope, no, nuh uh, not me, not in there, forget it”, so Peele really knew what he was about, choosing that title."
"Middling Peele may be light years beyond the usual summer-movie schlock, but even his most ardent admirers should be able to tell the difference between a film he has to make and a film he wants to make."
"Jordan Peele's NOPE offers the writer-director's spectacular spin on crowd-pleasing entertainment, but the pace is marred by awkwardly embedded subtext."
"Provocative themes are ample, offered up to viewers if they care to engage. That’s what makes this film one with great storytelling: it’s accessible in a way that entertains, while making weighty statements to prove a point."
"Given the expectations for Nope, I’d call the movie a letdown. Nope made me long for the moment when the film would find itself, and I, in turn, would find it."
"Jordan Peele's biggest film in scope and scale, but most constrained looking at the message underneath it."
A rare misfire from Jordan Peele...
There’s a better film hiding in this extravagant cowboy hor/mys/sci-fi. Peele’s followers and horror fans may ignore the lulls and remember the thrills. Others may feel frustrated waiting and waiting for something to happen.
Peele’s latest winner adds a command of spectacle to his already impressive filmmaker toolbox.
"...a chilling, chuckling science-fiction Western."
A fun and suspenseful sci-fi western that puts a fresh spin on the summer blockbuster formula. [Full Review in Spanish]
Way too hung-up on theme and allegory at the expense of solid storytelling mechanics... the film improves immensely when it drops it in favor of just walloping us with immaculate suspense scenes.
"Peele’s pacing is slow, the story dragging towards a conclusion that doesn’t seem worth the trouble it takes to sit through."
"Peele is well on his way to being among those who have refocused the art form, and Nope will ensure that we keep watching."
"Nope is a stellar film that mixes comedy, horror, and science fiction into a beautiful cinematic experience to make one of the best films of 2022."
Nope showcases a compelling spectacle crafted with remarkable craft and intelligence.
"Peele is paving his own way and creating his own style.  If anyone asks me if I’d ever pass on any of his future work, there’s only one correct answer… NOPE."
"NOPE is familiar territory in the horror genre, possible aliens, falling objects, and animals acting weird as shit."
"This is about watching and waiting.  About what if that thing that you are chasing devours you? It's about spectacle - this awesome sight - but there’s another side to that. 
The dark daunting side.  Awe includes fear."
"I greatly enjoyed the discovery of the plot’s daring and inventive twists and turns, along with the discerning and speculative ideas that they bring to light. By remarkable design, the movie is as full of action as it is light on character psychology."
Made to be seen in a theater!
"Peele never achieves artistic unity... [He] wants to play both sides with a film that presents itself as a blockbuster, but it's burdened with all the worries of an art film. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The appeal of Peele’s ideas far outshine the limits of the execution here. But if this trend continues, it feels inevitable that balance will shift unfavorably --and sooner rather than later. Nope is good enough, for now."
"Peele’s third feature may feel like a departure from his grounded horror, but through his characters, he finds manna from heaven may not always be welcomed."
Peele offers a science fiction movie that feels fresh even while he makes subtle nods to the sci-fi movies that came before it. Nope is a movie to which you have to say yes.  [Full review in Spanish]
This is a slow burn as Peele amps up this unnerving feeling of a close encounter with aliens. I could audibly hear people around me jumping and screaming as Peele pulls out a few jump scares.
"For all that it has on its mind, Nope doesn’t slack on being a suspenseful and genuinely scary movie. Jordan Peele is drawing on our cultural language for UFOs and then twists them in ways that are impossible to expect."
Peele is shooting for so much here at times that it is too easy for us to lose track of what we should be aiming at. Often it feels like a bunch of dissertations searching for a cohesive story that fails to satisfy intellectually or emotionally.
Peele prefers to slow roast his audience by raising the heat under the pot gradually. We are cooked tender by the film's end.
Nope is one of the most invigorating pieces of science fiction in recent years and sees a master of his craft delivering a spectacle where you can’t avert your gaze.
"In this sci-fi Western, Jordan Peele provides some scary suspense - but because the characters are not fleshed out, the payoff is minimal."
"Nope delivers a tale of extraterrestrial terror packed with powerful symbolism, potent scares, and tremendous performances from its cast."
"The film is gorgeous, with stunning special effects and impeccable cinematography. The cast all perfectly play their roles, and the mix of humor, adventure, and drama works wonders."
Jordan Peele mixes and matches elements taken from big blockbusters and obscure subgenres alike to create a heart-racing nightmare that rains abominable filth down on its audience.
"Si bien NOPE tiene sus fallas, sigue siendo una película bien ejecutada que cumple su propósito. Es un thriller de ciencia ficción lleno de suspenso que encaja en el molde de los blockbusters."
It's fine.
"His third film is the most mainstream, big-budget, and studio film he has made so far, even if some of the plot points don’t quite connect."
"In a world of regurgitated franchise reboots Nope certainly stands above the status quo, but when you’re this heavily invested in retooling and commentating on what came before it’s hard to see Nope as anything more than an echo."
"Peele has made an intriguing puzzle with Nope. It’s gratifying when the pieces are put together, but the satisfaction is more intellectual than visceral."
"Peele has not become completely shallow. In a form more muddled than his best films but still effective, “Nope” is about our drive towards the spectacular."
Those who see Nope might not get exactly what they’re expecting but they may enjoy it anyway.
"While less engaging on a purely visceral level then his pervious works, Nope remains true to Jordan Peele's reputation as a filmmaker who can pack dense themes and ideas into his work; this time setting his sites on Hollywood's explotative history."
Even a flawed Jordan Peele film still has a lot to offer and gives you a lot to think about.
"Nope is Jordan Peele’s most giant and ferocious swing yet. With John Carpenter’s craftsmanship and a Hitchcockian mastery of building tension, Peele creates an otherworldly summer spectacle."
"Very few have delivered on such a viscerally entertaining, intelligent and profound level as Peele does here."
"While we still keep waiting for Peele to replicate the searing social commentary of “Get Out,” he instead produces a triumph of cinematic atmospherics."
"The film’s secret may take a few minutes to digest, and the final act feels slightly rushed, but Peele knows how to keep you on the edge of your seat and that he does. Like an amusement park ride, his third feature is tense, scary, and above all, fun!"
". . . an oddball assortment of images, scenes and, just maybe, messages in another creative Peele effort that will make you both laugh out loud and squirm in your seats."
"‘Nope’ is a spectacular Maybe.  Peele serves up out-of-this-world ideas, but we have to muddle through odd detours to get there."
"While certain sequences and elements feel more impactful than the film as a whole, it's an undeniably impressive achievement on nearly every level, cementing Peele's status as one of the most interesting mainstream American filmmakers working today."
"‘Nope’ is an entertaining, thrilling, and just plain fun Western alien that further solidifies Jordan Peele as a modern master of the genre and its many forms."
"It may not send shivers up anyone’s spine, but it will beguile, amuse, and occasionally offer a genuine jump-and-scare moment."
"The movie can be seen as a restaging of Peele’s own first film. Or it can be seen as a call to peers to find new spectacles, bigger, better and less racist than Kong."
"When this film works, it is absolutely thrilling... [But] it feels like the script should have been tightened."
"It's a scary phenomenon, and it's one that [Jordan Peele] milks very well."
"While Jordan Peele shows he can handle spectacle, the murkiness of the storyline, unlikeable characters, and lack of focus in the plot makes this a miss."
Jordan Peele maintains his track record as a master of suspense with the eerie to the extreme 'Nope.'
"Well-shot and initially intriguing, but ultimately undercooked, uneven and underwhelming without taking enough risks. Jordan Peele knows where to take his many ideas in Nope from, but not where to take his ideas to."
"Born from the Covid lockdown of 2020 and one of the few positives to come from that debacle, Nope is what happens when immensely creative minds have plenty of idle time to do what they do."
"One may not be able to tame a predator, but we can embrace cinema that makes us have provocative, awe-inspiring conversations.  In my opinion, Nope accomplishes all of that."
Nope is a spectacle in the least derogatory sense; a palimpsest of nostalgic blockbusters and Jordan Peele’s deservedly self-assured vision of Hollywood’s future.
"As expected, it is quite a spectacle and is sure to thrill and chill. While more sci-fi than horror, there are still some scary moments. Not much else should be said, but instead discovered on the big screen."
"As far as Jordan Peele movies go, Nope is his weakest of the bunch. However, it still might be one of the best genre films of the year."
"If Get Out signaled the writer/director’s arrival and Us proved his first film was no fluke, his latest, Nope, cements Peele’s status as an elite filmmaker."
Nope’s junk pile of references combines movie and TV lore to no particular effect.
"Nope is a good example of how a film turns out when a lauded director... proves too fond of his own flourishes to trim the fat, to worry about whether his ideas cohere, or to respect the dramatic imperatives of the form in which he is working."
"As he pulled the rug out from under me for the umpteenth time, I sat in the theater muttering “Jordan Peele, you magnificent bastard.”"
"You’ll see a lot of stuff you’ve never seen before in “Nope,” and on top of that it is an impeccably well-made movie – so those two things alone make it worth your attention."
"Peele explores another genre while still keeping a few of his signature elements to capture his audience. In the end, Nope will leave you confused and wanting more answers."
"Nope is impeccably acted, meticulously paced, and resplendent with bold visual nonsense. Peele’s “Twilight Zone” may be dead, but his leveraging of Serling's sensibilities into mainstream fiction continues that franchise’s legacy better than any reboot."
"Nope is probably the best UFO movie since Close Encounters, though the sense of wonder is here tinged with the sinister and unwholesome."
"A little bit Close Encounters, a little North by Northwest, Nope is nonstop entertainment. Working with Oscar winner Daniel Kaluuya (his version of Cary Grant), Peele weaves a wild Western UFO tale."
"I never felt that engaged with the characters or, ultimately, the story despite some standout individual moments."
"Peele’s most ambitious film yet, but also his most disjointed."
"It's the kind of film where loose ends, and visible unsightlinesses are part of the process, allowing the writer/director the creative freedom to engage with his muse without having to get caught up in the preciousness of perfection."
"Nope grapples with enough issues of representation, voyeurism, exploitation, and spectacle to fill up 10 philosophy classes. Which is not to say it’s not just a straight-up thrilling and hilariously unhinged horror/sci-fi."
"...a densely-layered analysis of where we stand as a culture, within a world where everything's made to feel big and consequential."
Jordan Peele's 'Nope' is so cool it wears its sunglasses at night.
"Mostly it’s about Jordan Peele making an aliens-attack movie on a big scale but also on his own terms, with infectious filmmaking energy, and I’m here for it."
"As usual with Peele, there’s a lot unpack, what with the symbols and allegories that gesture toward the business of spectacle: wrangling the incredible and the tragic for our entertainment or curiosity."
"While there are a handful of scary and intense sequences, this is much more akin to a film like Jaws or Tremors than it is Fire in the Sky."
"If you're into strong performances and creepy images masterfully shot, this is your film. But if you're looking for suspense, jump scares, a coherent plot and motivation that involves more than an Oprah money shot, will you find it here? Nope."
The movie mixes awe and wonder and loneliness and more than a little terror into a frightening brew.
If 'Signs' was intentionally funny.
NOPE proves that Peele is not afraid to take risks with originality while honoring the things that have molded him into the filmmaker he is today.
Nope is a twisted social commentary of the highest order.
"Nope is a bloody, creepy UFO movie, unexpectedly gross in spots, with several different ideas knocking around in its head."
"Things begin to crumble when it comes to character development and the weirdly drawn-out final act, when all the film's loosely drawn threads are meant to come together and simply don't."
Peele remains a master of misdirection.
"With Nope, Peele himself creates a spectacle, entertaining us with stunning imagery and bloody violence that's worth going to the theater for."
"Jordan Peele has again reinvigorated the horror genre with a concept that is equal parts unique and absurd, is stunningly shot, and imbued it with an ending that is tailor-made to be hotly debated and scrutinized."
Peele has built a reputation that he almost bristles against in this movie.
"Peele has always had an eye for bold, visual storytelling, but there’s a majesty to Nope’s sweeping shots of the California desert that feels reflective of his evolution as a filmmaker and of cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema’s artistic sensibilities."
"Peele manages an agreeable mix of laughs and frights, even if you’re not sure what exactly he’s trying to say."
"A grounded, even earth-bound first act drama invisibly morphs into a spinning, scifi carnival ride of a climax, dropping some remarkably well-executed horror scenes along the way."
"Some of it is fascinating and frightening, but too much of it is frustrating. And when a scary movie stops being so and drifts into incoherence and the nonsensical, it’s confounding."
"[B]y the end, it's little more than a monster movie that dismisses its best ideas and doesn't take the remaining ones seriously enough."
"Nope is Peele’s most accessible, audience-friendly film to date, dealing less with heavy, social metaphors (aside from men exploiting animals for labor and entertainment) and going straight for the popcorn jugular."
Not quite.
