review
"Director Taika Waititi successfully juggles the comic and the tragic in Marvel Studios’ “Thor: Love and Thunder."""
"The story does a fantastic job of giving us new aspects to explore with Thor; not as a god, but as a hero."
"There’s enough meat on the bones for the film to provide middling entertainment, but it’s a shame Waititi seemed to have so little to really flesh the movie out."
In a deft twist on class war – the gods bleed gold – Thor must confront his privilege and make amends for other gods’ failures to keep promises.
"Despite its great acting, score and worldbuilding and epic character moments, Thor: Love and Thunder feels like one continuous joke that doesn’t land."
No spark or brio in its romantic affairs or CGI-filled action sequences... frustratingly one-note comedic panderings undercut any attempt at developing an emotional story arc.
"A bittersweet story about finding peace and love in suffering and pain, without forgetting the necessary thunderous action that reaches its best level in a long sequence surrounded by a breathtaking black-and-white color palette."
Romantic action comedy you need this summer! An action packed hilarious but also poignant film on change! Taika Wrote a wonderful story that I just fell head over heels for!
The film’s final scene explains the rationale for the film’s title and shows a glimpse of a different path Love and Thunder could’ve taken. A path that would have been more fit for Waititi’s vision of an 80s romance adventure hijinks-filled movie.
"Thor: Love and Thunder is gorgeously shot, chaotically executed, tonally inconsistent at times, and yet a joy ride even when it pushes deeper into the cruelties of life."
"Thor Love and Thunder is one of the worst movies of the year. From the first frame to the last, it’s unengaging, insipid, and tedious."
"With one of the shortest runtimes we’ve seen from Marvel in a while at only 119 mins, the much-awaited Thor: Love and Thunder is the definition of here for a good time, not a long time!"
"There may be thunder, but lightning does not strike twice."
"Therein lies Thor: Love and Thunder‘s biggest issue, its inability to balance tone and spectacle."
"Thor: Love and Thunder's editing routinely works against Taika Waititi's film, often undoing the emotional work the film is attempting to deliver."
"Taika Waititi and Chris Hemsworth leaned heavily into the more goofy aspects of Thor: Ragnarok. Thor: Love and Thunder piles on the jokes, bathos and stupidity until the film feels more like a parody of the MCU rather an addition to it."
"I’m laying down the hammer a bit more harshly because somewhere hidden in this messy pastiche to 80s fantasy movies is an adventure worthy of the gods. Unfortunately, hilarity and humanity fail to harmonize in Thor: Love and Thunder."
Overall a fun time but not the big blockbuster some might be expecting and certainly not recommended if you didn’t find Ragnarok very funny…
"Hemsworth has always been likeable as the smug superhero-god with the Adonis-like physique to match, but the risky attempt to transfer that charisma or to spread it around to other characters is not a gamble that pays off."
"'Love and Thunder' will remind you of fantastical adventure films like The Neverending Story, where the impossible can happen. At the same time, it may get in its own way trying to tackle as much as it does."
"It's bonkers in the best possible way. It's silly, laugh-out-loud funny and never takes itself too seriously. For those who have been living on a steady diet of Marvel films, this one delivers hilarious one-liners, jabs and Easter eggs."
"In Love and Thunder, Waititi pulls off a sneaky, deeply cool move—one that'll likely go unappreciated."
Proves to be more spoof than smash.
"Waititi seems driven to tell a story about Gorr and Jane Foster, allowing Christian Bale and Natalie Portman to outshine their peers. Bale simply outclasses the rest of the cast, appearing obscenely menacing and haunted by grief."
"Years after ""Ragnarök"", Waititi seems stuck in a facsimile of that same register to diminishing returns. What was previously fresh air has grown stale and “Love and Thunder"" more dull and and unspectacular. Not quite godlike."
"As a huge fan of Thor: Ragnarök, this film left me bitterly disappointed and to be honest, quite heartbroken since I had such high hopes for it."
Why should we feel anything when clearly none of it matters?
What's missing is any freaking hint as to where all this is going. <i>Love and Thunder</i> is the sixth (sixth!) movie in Phase Four of the MCU and we still don't know what the endgame (no pun intended) is.
"I not only think that this is the worst Taika Waititi's movie, but also one that occupies a privileged place at the top of the Olympus of the most boring of the MCU. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Taika Waititi's Thor Love and Thunder was a disappointment of godlike proportions, featuring a villain that deserved a much better film."
"What makes the film durable and winning is the rare blend of comedy and serious drama weight, which is pushed through by a game cast."
"As visually memorable as the sequence can be, narratively, it’s wet spaghetti flung at the plaster and wacky-wallwalking its way to the floor."
"... Not just the best Marvel movie yet made, but a bona fide camp comedy classic: fast, bright, gaudy, prickly, antic and fun."
It brings up a lot of interesting ideas and ultimately does almost nothing with them.
"A refreshing venture back to what the MCU is best at delivering: summer popcorn films. You get exactly what you expect: two hours of laughs, colorful scenery, and thunderous joy."
"Hilarious, irreverent and full of crowd pleasing moments. However, there are moments where the story development suffers in favor of the humor, and ultimately the fourth film is not quite as strong as Ragnarok"
Thor: Love and Thunder is merely a subpar love story meshed within a subpar superhero action movie.
Oh how the mighty have fallen! Taika Waititi was clearly given significantly more freedom here and it is not a good result. The slapstick comedy is way too frequent and makes the film feel like a spoof of it's own characters. It's dumb fun...but not much.
"Here’s the thing about Thor: Love and Thunder, the fourth solo outing for the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s God of Thunder: pretty much every individual element works on its own, and almost none of it works taken as a whole."
"This is not an action film with humor, this is a comedy with action. Don't take it too seriously and you'll have a lovely time. Russell Crowe knocks it out of the park."
They should have simply let James Gunn play with Thor in Guardians 3 and given Jane Foster her own Mighty Thor film so as not to relegate her into footnote status. Thank goodness for Bale. [His] grief’s authenticity proves how superficial the rest is.
"Thor: Love and Thunder is lacking in both love and thunder, and could have used more dramatic tension and more palpable, affecting stakes."
"The jokes, the catch-phrases, just incredibly tired..."
"Thor: Love and Thunder had a great opportunity with Portman as the new Thor & Bale as the God Killer but they were under utilized. At times this was downright silly, visual effects were not well done, & this was one my least favorite Marvel films to date"
I love me some Taika Waititi!  The Oscar-winning filmmaker has a perfect touch when balancing drama and humor.  And that touch is on full display in “THOR: Love and Thunder.”
A silly new Thor.
"There’s dry wit throughout this movie, but also a sense of unearned familiarity."
The resulting tone is so sloppily winking and unserious that it feels grotesque.
"I'll say this about Thor: Love and Thunder, it tries a little of everything. Unfortunately it results in a pretty disappointing mess."
Hemsworth is a dream - he really understands his own strengths as a performer and as a thing to be objectified.
The idea that Waititi has made the Thor films throwaway comedic fluff is nonsense.
"Is Thor: Love and Thunder a bad film? I don’t know, but maybe it’s time to reevaluate 2013’s Thor: The Dark World as the franchise’s weakest entry…"
"There's plenty of great ideas here, but the movie plays too much as a comedy to take any of it seriously."
"""I feel like this movie was the maturation of Thor because you saw and understood why he went through his depressive states in Infinity War/Endgame. As the movie progresses you see that his happiness is truly based on the love he has missed."" Naturally Na"
I thought it was fun but it definitely was way too silly to take the Gorr storyline more seriously. I wish we had seen more of Gorr actually butchering gods.
This felt like a chore to get through it. Cinematography was the best aspect of this film. The humor got redundant very quickly...
Thor: Love and Thunder is both a classic Thor adventure and a middle-age crisis comedy (if that exists within the context of a god's lifespan). [Full review in Spanish]
"Falling short in giving real weight to any threats to overcome, the fifth Thor film settles into a story about love, loss, and sacrifice that every viewer can relate to while still wallowing in mandatory spectacle."
"Too much to handle in less than two hours and feels simultaneously lazier and more overwrought than earlier entries, but an effective escapist event nonetheless."
This Thor flick is the compendium of all things that should not be done when it comes to superhero movies.
"Many critics have noted the bloodlessness and sexlessness of the MCU. Thor: Love and Thunder seems self-conscious about the latter, while doing little to change it."
Yawn.
One of the best MCU films yet.
"Taika Waititi seems to think he can carry us through a ludicrous story on the strength of a performative comedian’s confidence alone, but it’s just too transparent."
It seems to be trying hard and only succeeding part of the time. It could be Waititi is just getting tired.
"The egregious storyline given to Natalie Portman’s Dr. Jane Foster in “Thor: Love and Thunder” is the latest example of the MCU doing its heroines so, so wrong."
Love and Thunder trips over its ambitions in a bloated and conceptually underbaked sequel.
It’s the pure heart of Thor—and Thor—and their story that saves Thor: Love and Thunder from its own excesses.
"Thor: Love and Thunder is a solid addition to the MCU, filled with laughs and thrills, but it ironically struggles with its villain and identity, just as Thor seems to."
Waititi recreates an adventure with the logic of a Monty Python parody in the world of superheroes. [Full review in Spanish]
"Despite its ample faults, the film nevertheless earns a modest recommendation, albeit one with more reservations than beachfront hotels during Spring Break."
"Thor: Love and Thunder contains that same vigor Waititi brought to Thor: Ragnarok, creating a film that’s a visually stunning blast with ‘80s rock flavor. However, its biggest flaw is the overuse of his schtick in trying to recreate Ragnarok's success."
"One of the most shockingly erratic, all-over-the-place movies that Marvel Studios has ever produced."
"It doesn’t always succeed, but while it never quite lives up to the power of its predecessor, Thor’s fourth solo outing does it at least remind you why you love the guy in the first place, and makes you glad he stuck around this long."
"While not the worst Thor film, Love & Thunder has a lot of potential in its fantasy adventure but rarely rises to become a worthy sequel to its superior predecessor."
"A simple plot, but it has the e elements to make it entertaining, and a fast pace so that it is not tedious.  [Full review in Spanish]"
"Ending on a sweet note, Thor Love and Thunder delivers the visual spectacle fans will be hoping for and, in Portman, another fantastic female hero. However, all the hair metal in the galaxy can’t disguise a franchise that has begun to repeat itself."
"For a movie seemingly made with the sole purpose of inserting as many goofy gags per minute as possible while employing a healthy dose of vivid colors and rousing GNR hits, Love and Thunder is shockingly lethargic."
"It is a love story about selfishness versus selflessness. The struggle between these two impulses is the very same struggle that is at the heart of what is going on in America, and the rest of the world. It could hardly be more relevant."
"...segues into a predictably overstuffed narrative that contains far too many larger-than-life, special-effects-heavy action interludes..."
"Despite its inconsistencies throughout, Love and Thunder still crackles with enough verve and energy to remain an entertaining addition to the franchise even if it doesn’t feel as vital."
"Taika Waititi’s “Thor: Love and Thunder” is a triumph to behold, staying true to the tongue-in-cheek humor with solid themes of love and family—it’s one of Marvel’s strongest films to date."
It's the seafood extender of Marvel movies.
"A grandiloquent goof...  Tee-hee, giggle-giggle from the get-go, and that’s all right: Taika Waititi is the filmmaker most disrespectful of the goings-on in the self-serious, overstuffed conversation pit of the larger Marvel Comic Universe."
"While satisfying viewing experiences are subjective and dependent on the individual watching, the stylistic risks and occasionally relatively daring tonal departures should be a welcome guest for all viewers."
"I think it's a good MCU film. It's different, it's wild, it's crazy, and I liked it."
[Portman] is engaging and credible in her action scenes. She seems to be having fun and it is fun to watch her.
"Thor is not a perfect film, but for me, it was the perfect two hours my cinematic soul wanted and needed."
"For those expecting a grandiose story with stakes as equal to Thor: Ragnarok, this movie will fall short, but if you go in just expecting an enjoyable film that the family can laugh along with, then this film will certainly deliver."
"Love and Thunder flies off in multiple plot directions, never quite making any one of them feel complete. The end result is enjoyable to watch because the characters are such good company, but the story’s a mess."
It’s more Pirates of the Caribbean than a Marvel spinoff. There are visually splendorous set pieces...
"New Zealand filmmaker Taika Waititi's second silly-scary, action-packed addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"... what it manages is a solidly entertaining and fun, if too goofy, Marvel adventure that won’t count among the studios best but is still satisfying enough for cinematic summer escapism."
Taika keeps these Thor movies from being a depressing slog with tons of color and humor.
The film passes through the nervous system without delivering any sustenance or even leaving a residue.
It's not as mighty as 'Ragnarock.'
"The best movie out of Marvel Studios in the last two years, the most fun and ingenious since the first Guardians of the Galaxy, and certainly the best cinematic offer from the titular protagonist. [Full review in Spanish]"
Scene after scene of potential gravitas is undercut by Waititi’s need to remind us at every turn how clever he is.
"The film is an aesthetic and storytelling mess from beginning to end, never knowing exactly what it wants to achieve while hindering most of its emotionally investing moments in favor of unfunny and irritating jokes."
"hor: Love and Thunder is an action-packed rip-ride of a marvel flick, whose clunky exposition isn’t enough to detract from the heartfelt central story and the (long overdue) focus on Jane Foster."
"Balancing a plot laden with god murder and child abduction and an irreverent joke- and gag-driven spirit isn’t easy, but this film is successful far more than it isn’t at doing just that. All in all? Pretty mighty."
[Y]ou may feel as if [Taika] Waititi’s hammer is hitting you over the head.
"It also has a star in Chris Hemsworth who gives it his all, with a cheekier-than-usual (wink, wink) take on the God of Thunder and lots of Guns ‘N Roses.  Welcome to the Jungle indeed."
Thor: Love and Thunder is mostly just a brightly colored filler episode that will likely be forgotten about like most of the Thor franchise.
Taika Waititi's mind is a fascinating place to be in. Only he can take you through Thor's dad bod-God bod-sad bod journey.
"Hemsworth is almost vaudevillian in Thor: Love and Thunder, one of the funnier superhero movies I've seen."
Bale really commits because that's what he does. But there isn't much to commit to when nothing matters except the next joke.
An obscenely entertaining rainbow highway straight to blockbuster heaven.
Perhaps this change in direction is Waititi’s way of remaining Marvel that they’ve been taking themselves too seriously and it’s time to do something new.
"Unfortunately, it was almost immediately apparent—in part from the presence of those Guardians—that the witty edge was a little dulled this time around..."
"There are things that make the film funny, but they don’t make the film good. Too often, Love and Thunder feels like a series of skits, peppered with cameos by actors from Waititi’s other projects."
"Director Taika Waititi can't quite recreate the alchemic chemistry of Ragnarok in this serviceable but less exciting sequel, partly because Jane and Thor's romance doesn't spark."
"The weight of the film is carried by the charismatic cast, each of whom is adept at comedy, drama and action. If only filmmaker Taika Waititi had added an edgy bite to raise stakes and deepen themes."
"I was really surprised by how moving it was, there is a lot of heart and I really enjoyed that about this film."
"There was some amazing action, some incredible laughs… Christian Bale made for one of my favorite villain's in the MCU."
"Thor: Love and Thunder is a bit of a disappointment, but it also shows Marvel’s ability to allow creative freedom for filmmakers amongst the more traditional superhero fodder."
Manages to burst through the muddled fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and puts its overarching themes in a clear and connective context.
I can't dislike a movie that features gigantic screaming goats.
"In spite of some pretty dark moments and a sullen subplot, the movie retains a sense of humour that, in turn, evens out the tone of the overall picture, which leans more heavily on slapstick and over-the-top occurrences."
"It pains me to say this, but I have very little love and only stern, judgmental thunder for Marvel’s newest Thor movie."
"Waititi’s follow-up has all the makings of the God of Thunder’s best adventure yet. Sadly, Love and Thunder proves that it’s possible to have too much of a good Thor."
"I was really compelled by the ideas Taika Waititi was teasing in this film, but the actual style of it -- the eagerness to please -- made me take a step back from everything. [But] what he's discussing is really smart."
"""An adventure that stretches the brand’s four-quadrant appeal over tonal landscapes as wide as Thor’s biceps with little regard for rupture."""
"If you’re looking for a fun, lighthearted action rom-com with a likable lead and plenty of laughs, Thor vs Gorr with a side of Korg is an enjoyable two-hour diversion. Nothing more, nothing less."
"Where ""Ragnarok"" poked irreverent fun at its genre, ""Love and Thunder"" feels geared toward the faithful, packed with the kind of cutesy asides and knowing winks that tend to exasperate outsiders."
Thor has been emasculated and is a co-star in his movie. It’s rote work for Hemsworth.
"In a franchise system which mostly exploits auteurs, Waititi’s Thor Universe is proudly personal. This cosmic comedy about love recalls how exhilaratingly imaginative superhero stories can be."
"Even what could be scary scenes, such as the kidnap of a bunch of children, are given a light touch. That robs Bale’s murderous villain of his threat."
There is a sublime stretch of Love and Thunder when the movie drops all pretense of being a coherent narrative...
"The vast majority of Waititi’s film is deeply, unapologetically silly."
"Taika Waititi, who got the balance about right in his previous Marvel outing, 2017’s Thor: Ragnarok, this time tilts too far towards zaniness... When the comedy falls flat it does so with a super-thump."
"...looks good on paper, yet falls short in execution."
"Hopefully the rest of the MCU’s Phase 4 will take a page from Love and Thunder by focusing more on relationships...And, please god(s), may future Marvel movies strive to out-gay this one."
"Thor: Love and Thunder falls short of expectations. It’s a wild, entertaining mixed bag of a ride that gets lost in the punchline. Taika’s cosmic epic brings plenty of love, but lacks patience with its story to feel the depth of its impact."
Waititi has an uncanny knack of mixing unexpected humor with serious drama and emotional truth.
Thor: Love and Thunder is a dull and boring cinematic adventure that lacks any of the magic or heart of Waititi's previous MCU outing.
"Waititi wants you to know that when you’re scared or alone, he’ll show up in that rocky CGI face and tell you about some awesome space Vikings."
A movie significantly more flawed than its franchise predecessor yet more fun than anything we’ve seen in Phase 4 thus far.
"There are moments in Love and Thunder when the film feels like a $185m megaphone, dedicated solely to amplifying the voice of Taika Waititi."
"After such an overload of serious-minded, intricately interconnected movies, “Thor: Love and Thunder” brings back a sense of humor to the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
People who’ve enjoyed previous outings with the god of thunder should be happy with this one.
"With more heartache and drama than any Thor film to date, this is vintage Waititi and a welcome return to form for phase four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"While Chris Hemsworth continues honing his comedic chops as Thor and the film remains consistently entertaining, those hoping Taika Waititi would breathe new life and excitement into the growing Marvel fatigue of Phase 4 will be disappointed."
"Taika Waititi seems to be still finding his footing with this franchise, and it may take him directing another film to find the right balance for these Asgardian heroes."
"""Overall, it's a rare two hour Marvel romp that doesn't take itself too seriously, gives us a burst of nostalgia, and quite a bit to ooh and ahh over as we stuff our faces with popcorn."
"Thunderous visuals and an electrifying Christian Bale elevate the film, but the excessive technicolor silliness, tone swings, and a lack of a plot make the experience exhausting."
"Although Thor is the centre of the story, he is such an incorrigible nitwit one begins to despair for the universe."
"Everyone is entitled to a misfire now and then, and that includes the gifted Kiwi performer and filmmaker most responsible for Thor: Love and Thunder. It’s a scattered affair that, at a certain point, is played as out-and-out comedy"
Waititi's Marvel superhero sequel to 'Thor: Ragnarok' features an imposing new villain in Christian Bale but is too crammed with one-liners and glitzy set pieces.
"As silly as the oversized screaming goats that punctuate the action, but it’s a greatly elevated silly."
"Bale's performance is the standout of this film. But ultimately ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" is an overly vivid and tonally uneven comedy filled with unearned moments that comes nowhere near its predecessor"
"A tender love story, a solid villain, a spaceship pulled by goats -- Taika Waititi has packed a lot into the latest addition to the MCU. Unfortunately, it's not enough."
It certainly helps that the actors driving the movie know their onions inside out and bring to the table a degree of natural flair.
Waititi knows how to be silly without being stupid.
"I wouldn't be surprised if news dropped about the ton of footage left on the cutting room floor. Everything amazing about the film was cut short from the runtime, but still was a fun Marvel ride that I'm eager to see again."
"Love & Thunder electrifies with laughs, love, and tragedy. Waititi takes the God of Thunder on his most personal and emotional journey that is both rich and sublime."
Taika Watiti delivers another hilarious and thrilling cosmic adventure that also has a surprising amount of poignancy and heart.
"While the blending of genres has become a tentpole for modern superhero movies, Love and Thunder is a vampire, sucking all the life from each genre it emulates."
"Thor: Love and Thunder is a comedy first, and a superhero movie second."
Thor: Love and Thunder is the movie that turns the Marvel Cinematic Universe into a great big joke.
"Love and Thunder is raucous, flashy, and vacuous, not satisfyingly fun."
The mighty Avenger ditches his doldrums to join erstwhile love Jane in the funhouse adventure 'Thor: Love and Thunder.'
Far from being the GOAT of the MCU despite the shrieking chariot-pulling goats. Bloated with CGI & the novelty of Taika Waititi's brand of humor seems to be wearing off. The rockin' soundtrack gets high marks & Christian Bale is the clear MVP as Gorr.
"Waititi clearly put a lot of love into Thor: Ragnarok. That is missing from Thor: Love and Thunder, which feels more like slapdash product."
"It may not make a heck of a lot of sense, but don't be surprised if you're smiling too much to notice."
"Thor: Love and Thunder has the verve of a glam-rock musical, full of Guns N’ Roses riffs, bursts of lightning, and technicolor travels along the Rainbow Bridge. But its core is the tender idea that we all crave and need love, even if it hurts to lose it."
"It's saturated and loud and beautiful to behold, but its ungainly plot and willingness to slip into every tonal alley leaves it searching for a point."
"“Love and Thunder” is nowhere near an unpleasant flop so much as it is just half-inert. Expecting the exhilaration of “Ragnarok” would be unfair, but nobody should ask for Diet Coke and get a glass of ranch dressing. Oh, we’ll still drink it…"
"Fun, hilarious, and silly, Taika Waititi once again makes an entertaining Marvel film in Thor: Love and Thunder. Bale may be the scariest-looking villain yet."
"A fun, gleefully goofy entry in the MCU that places a premium on laughs and skimps on characterization. Love the '80s homage."
"As in 2017's delightful Thor: Ragnarok, Waititi plays this material for goofy laughs; there are cosmic gags here worthy of Melies. It's very silly, but unlike Ragnarok, it isn't only silliness."
"When it's a 'Thor' movie, it's great! When it's a 'Minions' movie, it's obnoxious."
"There is no imperative driving Love and Thunder beyond its obligations to the gods of content, an empty shell of a film covered up with endless jokes and attractive people standing in front of exceedingly bland green screens."
"There's a lot of fun in Thor: Love and Thunder. It's a worthy successor to Thor: Ragnarok (my favorite, and despite what Natalie Portman claimed, still the gayest Thor movie)."
"This film can be best described as fun, with Chris Hemsworth and the rest of the cast able to convey Waititi’s trademark subversive humor in mostly entertaining fashion."
"Taika continues to prove his brilliant understanding of the idiosyncrasies of friendships, envy, and of course hilarity. There's a wealth of parental warmth to the film. He's the GOAT. Be warned it can't bring the novelty of reinvention that Ragnarok did."
[Taika Waititi] wants you to know that he’s the kid with red crayon scribbling all over a genre that is often more stone-faced than it should be.
"Despite being a movie about magic hammers and space gods, Thor: Love and Thunder is a very funny film in which we see Thor wrestle with very human problems."
"[Gorr] does seem to be onto something — the gods, floating obnoxiously above the fray of mortal concerns, kind of suck. Unfortunately, this movie is about one of them."
"In this instance, Waititi has failed in modulating tone... The gravity of some of the characters and the effervescence of others ail each other in the worst way. [Full review in Spanish]"
"You know how some superhero movies take themselves so seriously you long for a moment of comic relief? Well here I longed for a moment of dramatic relief. But Taika Waititi gets away with the frantic pacing, always delivering tons of good, gregarious fun."
"It’s never a good sign when a highly anticipated, mega-budget summer superhero movie is so dull that you’d rather take a nap."
"It can be rip-roaring fun, but it doesn't seem to sail anywhere in particular."
"I guess Thor is now Marvel Universe comic relief. The Screaming Goats, the face-off between inanimate objects and Zeus is all funny, but why does the main villain disappear for so long? Regardless, it's popcorn entertainment and delivers the goods. Aiyee!"
"This film has funny bits, goofy moments (the goats are wacky fun), a kicking jukebox soundtrack, and a worthy villain. Still, it lacks the cohesive elements that convincingly pull the story together."
"Prioritizing the yuks while telling a story in which a villain called Gorr the God Butcher is, as you would expect, executing gods but also kidnapping children is a tricky business."
"The best dark moments in Waititi's quick-moving adventure finally arrive later, during an eerie black-and-white sequence that brings Hemsworth's ""Space Viking"" into a kind of barren, yet mind-bending Twilight Zone. If only all of it landed so neatly."
"While not as game-changing as Ragnarok, Love and Thunder once again shines brightly with a flashy confidence as it takes audiences on a wildly entertaining journey of love and adventure."
"Some may take the funny parts of Thor: Love and Thunder and give it more credit than it actually deserves. But its uninspired story, a villain who makes little sense, and other missteps show that the MCU has a long way to go before it regains its mojo."
"It's something to be both entertained but also bored, and moved at times when otherwise not engaged one iota. Viewer mileage will likely wildly vary."
"It’s as big and bold and vibrant as you’d expect a top-tier comic book film to be and also as shallow, but the spectacle is so strong and the cast so uniformly talented that it all works. This film is peak Himbo Energy and I can dig it."
Bringing Russell Crowe in to play Zeus -- in a scene that goes on much too long -- is an idea that must have been hatched during an all-night mead bender.
"After doing the tough task of redeeming and frankly diverting the MCU into more fun, frolic end with Thor: Ragnarok, Taika Waititi is back with a tonally inconsistent and empty spectacle that doesn’t just lack laughs, but also lacks levity."
"Love and Thunder is also surprising ugly: just flat, bad, obvious CGI backgrounds and greenscreen work that makes the whole thing feel especially weightless."
"Waititi leans into the humor he brought with Ragnarok, so if you're looking for more of that - you're in for a fun time."
It’s much too similar to what came before but there is just enough spark in Thor: Love and Thunder to recreate the electricity.
"It’s barely half as funny, fierce, romantic and thrilling as 2017's ab fab Thor: Ragnarok, but director Taika Waititi and self-mocking  star Chris Hemsworth get such goofball jollies  sending up the usual Marvel bloat that you won’t be able to resist."
"I have no doubt this’ll divide the fanbase as much as Iron Man 3, if not more so, but if you loved that film’s boldness and willingness to take risks, you owe it to yourself to give Thor’s latest classic adventure a whirl."
"…the intent is more often to generate laughs than thrills or drama, and that’s welcome…"
Waititi’s direction doesn’t buckle from the grandiose and his vision capitalises on a diverse and rich colour palette and grand special effects resulting in some jaw-droppingly gorgeous set pieces.
"Love and Thunder is equally mischievous and jumbled. It's chaotic in both fun and messy ways. Out in the cosmos, no one can swim, but movies about galaxy-saving superheroes can tread water."
"Waititi's affinity for goofy characters foisting their awkwardness upon one another makes for a charming twist on the Marvel formula, but in the end not even the gods are powerful enough to survive the steamroller of this cinematic universe."
Thor: Love and Thunder just drags a bit too much ass and gets too distracted by itself to really stand up to snuff. It's not really bad as much as it is just kind of perfunctory. It exists because it has to.
"It's not bad, but it has the same look & feel as about a dozen Marvel movies & TV shows before it. This may be what Marvel fatigue looks & feels like."
"While it may be a bit too goofy for its own good, it’s still fun, an entertaining and welcome entry in the series."
"It's an enjoyable effort, not at all hard to like, but it... misses."
A movie more interested in ironic laughs than furthering the MCU’s mythology or delivering cohesive behaviors.
"There are more tangible laughs to be found here than in the vast majority of films of this scale, but this ultimately feels like more of a collection of nice moments than a story that necessarily needed to be told."
It leans heavy on the comedy to the point where the movie feels like an MCU parody of Thor rather than a Thor adventure and to be honest... the movie ended in a way that i just didn't find fulfilling.
A bit of a letdown after the intoxicating hijinks of Thor: Ragnarok. Hela is way more fun than Jane Foster. Hemsworth and Bale are in two different movies.
"This wouldn’t matter as much if Love and Thunder were fun to watch unfold, with some of the well-constructed and stylish imagery that Waititi at least brought to the table with Ragnorok or his other films, but it’s a visual mess."
"Overall, I really like Thor: Love and Thunder. There's a lot of elements in this movie that work really well for me."
"Though Chris Hemsworth, as usual, has a lot of fun in the title role, the film around him too often strains to provide excitement and laughs."
"Throughout three movies, Thor and Jane haven't been able to produce enough moments to compile a fast montage of a relationship that blooms and wilts with the caliber of a mediocre rom com. A piddling story of love. Or of thunder. [Full review in Spanish]"
"No one will ever accuse Taika Waititi of deep cerebral epics that are discussed over Turkish coffees in mahogany-lined private libraries, and that’s exactly why we love him."
"You do not need to watch any show on Disney+ to fully enjoy this one, nor wrap your head around complex cosmologies or multiversal madness."
"These superhero movies keep coming out with their own personalities, and the odd sweetness in this one makes it endearing."
"Coming in at just under two hours (a rarity for any film nowadays, especially a Marvel blockbuster), Thor: Love and Thunder is in too much of a hurry to get from joke to joke at the expense of gradation and character development."
"Whenever [Bale's] on screen, the movie is far richer than it deserves to be. But Love and Thunder's schtick is starting to seem more than a little desperate."
"As Marvel movies continue to wander aimlessly in search of purpose in its post-Endgame phase, Taika Waititi takes that lack of direction and tries to build something light, loveable and fun on top of it. It mostly works. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Waititi’s playfulness buoys “Love and Thunder,” but the insistence on Thor’s likability, his decency and dude-ness, has become a creative dead end."
"Ultimately, “Thor: Love and Thunder” isn’t a bad movie, just a frustratingly disappointing one."
"So, as a non-fan, I found it entertaining, funny and a little bit somber. Would I watch it again? No, thanks. Am I going to talk to the fans and find out what they think? Absolutely!"
Delivers more of a knockabout comedy than a full-throttle action adventure.
"... Incredibly fun, the best Marvel film since Ant Man and the Wasp (2019), shows magnificently Foster's empowerment journey without the need to cram in an obvious message. [Full review in Spanish]"
"It’s all a bit Monty Python, a bit Wes Anderson, but mostly reminiscent of the kind of self-mocking TV ad that draws on classical mythology to sell chocolate or get us to switch mobile plans."
"Add more than a touch of moving pathos at the end and the film delivers enough cinematic goods to justify its place in the Marvel pantheon. Still, somebody needs to edit Waititi, for his own sake and ours."
"Love and Thunder resets Thor back to where he was at the beginning of the first film: a vain, greedy, cruel boy. Just with puppy-dog eyes whenever Jane turns up."
"Thor: Love and Thunder isn’t an all-out action-comedy like Ragnarok. It juggles life-and-death concerns, is rooted in grief and pain, but Waititi’s singular style, Hemsworth’s charm and a heartfelt examination of the pain and pleasure of love is a winner."
"Thor: Love and Thunder is a weird and wonderful cosmic adventure which truly wears its heart on its sleeve, as the God of Thunder (and company) journey on a charming and surprisingly sentimental quest."
"The studio has stumbled into what may be the worst film yet in its long line of spectaculars, an erratic and fatally dull morass of limp jokes and aimless plotting."
"Most of “Thor: Love and Thunder” is a mess, pleased with itself and tonally everywhere. As bad as one of the better “Pirates of the Caribbean” movies, but that’s still pretty horrible."
"Thor: Love and Thunder is as flawed in its logic as the myths it’s based on but, like them, it nevertheless makes a good bedtime story."
"It’ll toss plenty of lore at the audience but never demand much in the way of thinking. We all get to be Thor for about two hours, essentially."
"Taika Waititi delivers a Chris Hemsworth follow-up to Thor Ragnarok every bit as colourful, weird, hilarious and downright entertaining - all with some added heart."
"The variations within the MCU remain minimal, but Love and Thunder finds a fun approach within its limited scope."
"[Waititi] conjugates comedy, action and adventure. Throw in a Chris Hemsworth comfortable in his Marvel superhero skin and his beloved's return, and well... as the protagonist himself put it: ""You've got a classic Thor adventure."" [Full review in Spanish]"
Superb god level nonsense. [Full review in Spanish]
Bale is phenomenal in this opening and thereafter... but it's a bit like if Heath Ledger's Joker was never allowed to ask someone how he got his scars (and then show them).
"The big finale’s worth waiting for through the erratic lead-up. Plus, who doesn’t enjoy screaming goats and a Marvel version of Voldemort?"
"""Love and Thunder"" has a goofy streak a mile wide, as if Waititi is letting us know he's fully aware of the ridiculousness of a bunch of muscle-y actors running around in Halloween costumes."
A fast-paced adventure of laughs and soap operas. [Full review in Spanish]
"An agile film, in which humor has more weight than density, with some salvageable passages. [Full review in Spanish]"
Thor: Love and Thunder makes it clear that both the Australian and Marvel do not intend this to be the last chapter of the son of Odin. [Full review in Spanish]
A solid movie that just doesn’t live up to the insurmountable expectations set by its predecessor.
Everything that works brilliantly in the film is all Waititi and so are all the glaring flaws.
"This is a ramshackle, choppy spoof that would work better if it existed in a vacuum, and not part of an over-arching cinematic universe."
It’s summer. The beefy guys are fighting. Let’s have a good time.
"True to its title, the new Thor film is one part big heart, but the other part is empty spectacle and great noise."
"Too silly to take seriously, there’s still a lot to love about Thor: Love and Thunder but, unlike Thor: Ragnarok, it’s unlikely to be a movie you’ll fall in love with. Marvel Studios may be developing a quantity over quality issue."
Thor: Love and Thunder is the queerest MCU movie yet.
"In yet another Thor movie where the character must find himself, at least the supporting cast has something interesting to do here."
Mighty uneven.
"It is so much fun and often genially goofy, two words that don’t usually apply to superhero movies, that it is satisfyingly entertaining"
The latest Thor is a severe thunderstorm warning that only amounts to a passing stray shower of creativity or two.
"Fittingly for a movie soaked in 1980s hair metal, 'Thor: Love and Thunder' dials things up to way past 11, but not always for the best."
"The filmic equivalent of McDonald’s food: hits the spot in the moment, fades from memory immediately upon completion, and was likely produced using a 3D printer."
"Thor: Love and Thunder suffers from narrative gaps, wild tonal imbalances, and weightlessness. More importantly, it under-utilises nearly every actor and character at its disposal."
Waititi teases greatness but the film never kicks into a higher gear as you keep hoping it will.
"Clearly, Waititi is having a lot of fun with this. It’s just that the viewer isn’t."
"As he picks up the Norse god’s mantle again in Thor: Love and Thunder, Waititi turns the dial up to 11, creating an off-kilter superhero movie that is equal parts humor and heart."
"Given the formulaic nature of the Marvel Studios house style, Waititi has crafted a successful if less than world-shaking sequel to his memorable Marvel debut."
"Thus far, the 2021-22 roster of Disney/Marvel post-pandemic titles has struggled to advance the series beyond Thanos in a meaningful fashion. Although it’s questionable whether Thor: Love and Thunder changes that, it has a helluva lot of fun trying."
"An allegedly wild and wacky but ultimately disappointing and disjointed chapter in the ongoing story of the God of Thunder, who seems to get more clueless with each passing movie."
"At times visually expansive and sparkling with Waititi’s infectious comedy, Thor: Love and Thunder nevertheless struggles to recapture lightning in a bottle."
"There was no way Taika Waititi was going to meet sky-high expectations he set with 2017's 'Thor: Ragnarok'. And he does fall way, way short with 'Thor: Love and Thunder'. But the film is not just disappointing, it is also a complete mess."
"Turns up the volume on everything; the humor, the music, the colors and, did I already mention that it has a lot of comedy? Fans of the comic book Thor will have to continue to settle for what is already in the first films. Full review in Spanish."
"This is what happens when a successful vision is copy-pasted ad nauseam, obliterating what was fresh just a few years back into lazy pastiche."
Thor: Love and Thunder ... remind[s] us that its eponymous superhero is one of the few surviving characters of merit in this expanded series.
"Even though it has its flaws, Waititi's usual flare makes it enjoyable. Despite feeling like a lot of things happened out of convenience to serve the plot, I had a good time. I guess that's what matters."
Thor: Love and Thunder is a fun movie with lots of great sequences ... but there’s a sense that Waititi’s ambitions got in the way of a more powerful version of this story.
It's clunkier and the humor more hit and miss than Thor: Ragnarok but then it really comes together in the second half and there are parts of this movie that are absolutely stronger and more emotional than Ragnarok.
Thor: Love and Thunder is my least favorite film in the MCU.
"While the film mainly plays as an action-adventure superhero comedy, Waititi can get serious when it counts. Thor’s deep fear makes him a much more well-rounded character and brings his emotional vulnerability to the forefront."
Might as well be called MCU Fatigue: The Movie.
"…a rollicking, hard-rocking slab of pure, unadulterated entertainment…"
"There might never be another Endgame, or even another Winter Soldier in this series. But as long as there are films as likeable, engaging and daft as Love and Thunder, I'll keep on watching them."
"It’s all very enjoyable, but inferior to Ragnarok in two respects. The plot here is a little too thin to carry all the pyrotechnics, and while the humour flowed with giddy ease in Ragnarok, in this likeable sequel it sometimes seems a little forced."
"[Thor: Love and Thunder] begins with a graceful homage to The Tree of Life and ends with a tear-jerking climax that could have been written by Nicholas Sparks. It’s a gratifyingly weird film, but it isn’t good."
"This one feels like a bunch of kids came up with superhero story ideas, and Waititi went along for the ride—it sounds like a cool idea, but the reality is messy and emotionally unconvincing."
One more instance to prove that good ingredients don't always make a successful mix. You'd need sensibility and a sense of adventure. Something Marvel can't offer right now. [Full review in Spanish]
"This flashy blend of heroics, heart and humor is sometimes too goofy to be taken seriously, but overall is an inspired take from director Taika Waititi, and that is reason enough to spring extra for the IMAX viewing."
A movie you see then immediately begin to forget.
... The comedic elements are way superior to the indigestible epic finale it attempts to accomplish. [Full review in Spanish]
These highlights can't cover up a weak script and a general sense of lethargy that plagues much of the film.
"Love and Thunder is such a hasty-feeling mess of a movie, it might get the viewer to come around to Gorr's bloodthirsty perspective."
"""Love and Thunder"" isn’t the same kind of comedic crowdpleaser as ""Ragnarok."" But for those who wanted just a touch more heft back in the ""Thor"" franchise, it’s a worthy installment."
"'Thor: Love and Thunder' is scattershot, awkwardly jumping around without any apparent cohesion. It hurriedly careens around the cosmos without much thought or depth."
"By nature of not actively destroying one of Marvel’s most imaginative achievements of the past few years, Love and Thunder manages to come out ahead of May’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness in a comprehensive 2022 Marvel ranking."
"Let’s hope Marvel can move past this misstep and pump up the Love and Thunder with more than a weird Zeus, Hemsworth’s butt and screaming goats. Waititi manages to create moments but not the epic fun comedy adventure we were THOR-oughly hoping for."
"... Flawless self-awareness, teasing the déjà vu of comic-book movies without ever insulting the audience. This is Waititi's secret sauce."
"Waititi is too preoccupied with trying to land the same jokes, and he burdens the film with a wishy-washy love story which even by the MCU’s low standards feels shallow and perfunctory."
"If you like romantic comedies then you're going to love Thor: Love and Thunder. That being said, Marvel's Phase Four feels aimless."
"A reasonably enjoyable lark...a tonally disjointed picture that doesn’t totally satisfy, but is still one of the better recent MCU efforts."
"There’s loads to enjoy here but after 29 MCU movies, is it time to mix up the formula? A bit more love and a bit less third-act thunder might be nice."
"With its streak of humanity, Love and Thunder is less broadly comic than Ragnarok, but it still leans heavily on humour, Waititi-style - sly, silly, smart and smart-alecky. And thanks to Waititi’s crisp editing, the film’s comedic timing is impeccable."
Crushing on his ex while protecting his own skin feels pretty superficial. It’s a slight premise with weak stakes.
"Do these zigzags and mood swings work? Not entirely. But at its fizziest, the camaraderie among the principals buoys the picture."
Marvel's campest entry yet but sadly ventures too far into parody
"Thor: Love and Thunder delivers everything I want in a sit-back-and-relax superhero adventure, which quite frankly is something we need."
