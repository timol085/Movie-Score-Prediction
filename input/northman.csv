review
"Filled with stunning cinematography, the film is an intense, immersive, sometimes surreal, descent into an otherworldly milieu of folkloric horror and medieval barbarism."
"As a bloody and most certainly trippy revenge tale, The Northman is astounding in many places. Eggers may not have created the ultimate Viking tale, but he has crafted an astonishing spectacle that combines his established style with something larger."
"Eggers’ visual style is a roller coaster of primordial, oneiric imagery of an epic, wild landscape, turbulent supernatural forces and untamed nature sans any whiff of domestication."
"Robert Eggers has crafted one for the ages… The Northman  is a cinematic epic that blew my mind from start to finish. Lavishing cinematography that brings to life this era, visceral violence that adds to the world, & a jaw dropping third act"
"The Northman is an incredibly gifted film full of hostility, genealogy, strength, and desire."
"Violent and powerful from start to finish, The Northman tells an epic, period accurate Viking tale that easily immerses its audience throughout the entire run-time."
"The Northman is a story that’s been told many times over, and save for showcasing the stunning scenery of Ireland, this adaptation is nothing to write home about."
"The Northman isn’t trying to elevate horror nor dismantle fetishistic fantasies. It’s a fully-formed exercise in realigning blockbuster pictures back to the way they should be: big, visually breathtaking, and bolstered by a unique vision."
"By the time the end credits hit, you will be waiting for it to begin anew, and that is one of the highest compliments you could give a movie of this size and breadth."
"It provides all the weirdness, gore, beauty and singularity that you would expect from this director’s take on a Viking tale of vengeance."
"The Northman’s carefully choreographed, single-shot takes and startlingly lit close-ups blow the spatially disorienting and over-edited style of so many contemporary action films completely out of the fjord."
"The Northman is practically bursting with testosterone. The story of Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård), a Viking Prince hellbent on revenge, Robert Eggers‘s third film is essentially a case study in the destructive nature of unyielding masculinity."
"Northman is one of Robert Egger best films. The scope, the scale, the atmospheric building of Norse mythology is groundbreaking. Along with some insanely well acted performances and beyond thrilling action and revenge based story. Must Watch Masterpiece!"
The Northman creates a unique saga that taps into something truly primal before one hell of an ending.
"An intoxicating and epic blend of violence, mysticism, and breathtaking visuals."
"Spectacle, pageantry and myth combine with blood, mud and abs for a dazzling, uproarious Viking spree in which Alexander Skarsgård seeks to avenge the murder of his father with the aid of Anya Taylor-Joy and Icelandic national treasure Björk."
"The Northman stands as a stark reminder that there is still a place in cinema for gorgeous, inspired odysseys, rife with literary allusions, deep-seated spiritual meanings, and an exploration of complex human emotions."
"This brutally violent, yet soaringly lyrical action epic is quite unlike anything captured on screen before."
"The Northman is an epic the likes of which we hardly see in Hollywood anymore, carefully curated by a master of the medium and packed with powerhouse performances."
Eggers is still a major reason to stay interested in whatever movies are becoming.
"Not since Christopher Nolan’s Inception has a studio executive shown such balls of steel, or perhaps I should say boller av stal."
"Eggers embraces the filth, the mud, the moss, the viscera that were part and parcel of the day."
[Eggers has] gone for broke with this epic arthouse blockbuster that mixes Hamlet and Gladiator through the lens of a hardcore metal album cover.
It is disappointing that The Northman goes past what would have been a truly radical ending and extends itself for a zany climax that qualifies as Valhalla porn.
"The Northman is a brutal and violent film, felt in both its protagonist’s appetite for revenge and a world that seems to require suffering to continue turning."
"The Northman isn’t exactly a triumph, but with its many knockout moments, it represents a big step forward for the youngish director Robert Eggers, who for the first time has a big budget ($90 million) to work with."
"Hopefully it will be received by audiences for what I believe it is: a memorable, harrowing, cautionary nightmare."
"""The Northman"" is winningly engaging at every turn and is best when it becomes an unabashed technical marvel. If it lacks the unpredictable looseness of “The Lighthouse” (Eggers’ best film) it offers clarity of vision with propulsive energy throughout."
A breathtaking cinematic onslaught that savvily turns hellishness into movie heaven.
"A new oddity in which horror, revenge and Norse mythology go hand in hand in one of the most suggestive and visceral shows that we've been able to enjoy on the big screen in the last years."
A ferocious revenge tale that's heavy on the blood and sweat but light on the tears.
The most violent film I’ve ever seen to also feature a stellar fart joke.
Gratuitously extenuating retina trips... A nightmare in its own right that portrays the tragedy and the end of a treacherous and ultra-masculinized world. [Full review in Spanish]
"Beastly warriors, assassinated kings, and soothsaying seers look down upon a brutal landscape where the common person could be free one moment and conquered the next with little to say in how their fate will play out... it's best to be prepared for both."
"While The Northman isn't, in the end, as wholly perfect as Eggers debut The VVitch, he's still three-for-three and more ambitious each time he gets behind the camera."
"You can tell Eggers wanted a more elevated, visually-driven movie and I hope a director’s cut shows up someday."
"Made me watch The Princess Bride. It's not a coincidence. Like The Northman, it's about vengeance, duels, fights, colorful characters, a love story that destiny couldn't break... I go to bed thinking about it. Not The Northman. [Full review in Spanish]"
Bobby Eggs might finally be starting to make movies that I can enjoy.
Director and co-writer Robert Eggers is fascinated by the sounds and textures of the pagan and the primal.
The Northman is an exceptionally crafted film with unconventional visuals and a filmmaking voice behind it that is powerfully unique.
"Blood runs, mud flies and bones crack — in crisp, percussive ways you’ve hopefully never heard in real life — throughout The Northman, a grand, gut-spilling Norse epic that feels at once earthily ancient and thrillingly modern."
"An authentic-looking and dream-filled world of a thousand years ago, sometimes beautiful and often brutal — but always fascinating."
"A savage and mesmerizing Viking saga like no other, Robert Eggers’ The Northman leaves your senses bludgeoned by the time the credits roll."
"A complete cinematic experience from the sound, score, acting, aesthetic, story, and directing is masterfully put together and executed."
"If you’re looking for a bold and nihilistic tale, you’ve come to – quite literally – the perfect place."
"It's brutal and violent, but there's something really beautiful about it."
"A magnificent Mise-en-scène, straddling the subtle and the brutally direct, in a narrative that fearlessly advances towards existential fatalism. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Nicole Kidman steals her scenes in this immaculately crafted tale of revenge. The action brings the heat, but the story may leave you cold."
"While the violence, blood, and mud won’t be for everyone, The Northman is a rewarding film for those who venture into its wilderness."
"A historical epic without the epic, a revenge plot with all the agency of revenge removed. What is left?  A two and a half hour plodding viking re-enactment."
"An all-too-rare modern example of an auteur-driven epic, The Northman demands to be seen on the biggest screen possible."
"This is not the sanitized, horned-helmet-wearing, Marvel comics Thor vision of Viking-hood. This is blood and mud and ice and pagan gods, and, reader, I am here for it."
"For all the nonsense The Northman trails in its wake, this is also a big, brawling and absolutely beautifully shot and scored film."
"There is no better word than “visceral”, in its broadest meaning, as a compact synthesis of everything that happens here. [Full review in Spanish]"
Eggers builds it as a visceral sword-and-sandal epic that never loses its rhythm of action or sense of spectacularity in portraying barbaric times. [Full review in Spanish]
"In The Northman, Robert Eggers sheds the title of a horror director. He shows just how far his range can lead him, and it is exciting to see him lean into that."
"It’s not a bad movie in the least, it just feels like a lot of the Eggers special sauce got watered down, even if the brutality went way, way up."
"A Shakespearean nightmare centering on the obsession in which rage reigns supreme, but also its poetry... [Full review in Spanish]"
"Eggers continues his seemingly meteoric ascent to world-class filmmaker status, expanding his toolkit to encompass a breathtakingly intense, attention-grabbing, single-take approach to scene and story creation unlike anything else."
It’s a man’s man’s man’s man’s man’s world.
"A ferocious, epic tale that is beautifully brutal."
"With its naked sword fight on top of an exploding volcano, The Northman is rad...its blood-soaked tale of vengeance right in line with the great Icelandic sagas, an epic cinematic rendering of a story that has been told for at least a thousand years"
"Visually it is darkly stunning, but storywise it is all over the place. Nicole Kidman is one film and Alexander Sharsgard is in another. Anna Taylor-Joy doesn't know where the heck she's supposed to be."
Eggers' film didn't resonate with me after I left the theater. I never felt pulled into the orbit of Amleth's revenge close enough to really empathize with his plight. Gorgeously shot yet oddly hollow emotionally.
"I wanted to love Robert Eggers’s follow-up to The Witch and The Lighthouse, but maybe a big-budget Viking saga just isn’t the right fit for a wonderful weirdo like him?"
"An immersive event from its first seconds.
[Full review in Spanish]"
"This is a movie that doesn't shy away from emotions, it embraces them fully. The actors don't shy away from overacting, either, they revel in it, and this is both refreshing and entertaining."
You genuinely feel how much his characters have faith in their gods and their folk tales as an extension of their everyday lives.
"The Northman is brutal, bloody and violent, even a little gory at times. But its beautiful aesthetics displayed in every shot and every sequence place it above other movies with similar topics. [REVIEW IN SPANISH]"
Hyper-stylized… form triumphs over substance.
"If we are fools in doubt, we can break the cycle of violence and revenge...or else leave behind a scorched Earth…where only losers can reside.
[Full Review in Spanish]"
"Epic, massive, and ostentatious. [Full review in Spanish]"
Eggers' latest is wicked and delightfully weird without ever losing its grip on being a compelling character study engulfed in dazzling imagery. It’s his best film to date and the most confounding studio film of the year.
...an epically-misguided trainwreck that couldn’t possibly be less interesting or involving.
"What Eggers has done with this film is to develop an intense story of revenge, without hiding how barbaric and bloody and brutal life was at that time for these people. Full review in Spanish."
"The Northman falls short of being an epic film, but the mastery in composition of the film is noteworthy."
"Execution, performance, and art direction are all unparalleled, but the whole simply proves a solid familial melodrama in the end. They can’t all be ""great."""
"Eggers has embraced the wildness. creating a world of primal ritual where the spirit realm regularly interacts with the material one, and life is nasty, brutish, and short. Mercifully so."
"Predictable at every turn, but the operatic style of the effects leave you entranced - even chilled - for the entire film"
"This is a film that gives what is wanted, without any regrets, through an environment that’s as angry as it is awesome."
"Drenched in testosterone, Northman is less concerned with reinventing the wheel with it's narrative built on the same mythology that inspired Hamlet, but rather with making you feel the visceral human anger and rage underpinning it's entire proceedings."
"A death-metal ode to honor, retribution and sacrifice that casts payback in a surprisingly, and thrillingly, positive light."
"It’s a good movie, yet also a little disappointing, because it’s not quite good enough to get away with being so little fun."
he tale of Amleth (played wonderfully here by Alexander Skarsgård) could be called Shakespearian.
"If meant to be a provocative meditation on freewill and revenge, and a bloody, visceral, painstakingly-detailed spectacle  it maybe only delivers on the spectacle."
"A violent, visceral, and engrossing voyage."
"Exciting and sprawling, The Northman is almost a throwback to an earlier time of movie-making, with a story of redemption, presented in a fascinating and spellbinding way."
"A brutal, testosterone-fueled profusion of ""Game of Thrones"", 300, and Kill Bill"
"Both beautiful and brutal, The Northman is a saga worth seeing."
"Skarsgård never once puffs his chest to assert his place as the hero, in complete alignment with Amleths sense of prophecy bestowed upon him at an early age."
"The storyline was simple yet effective. The landscape, the production values -- I was all in."
"Overall, despite the lavish treatment, the film is surprisingly dreary..."
"It's the creative juices of Robert Eggers that gives The Northman its unique identity, from the impeccable detail and design to the wild flourishes and overindulgences."
"As we get to summer with a lot of polished blockbusters, this is something a bit grittier, and a bit more interesting."
It's Hamlet with a lot more blood and a lot less clothes.
"Striking and compelling, for a film that toys with the concept of defying one's fate, the narrative does feel disappointingly stuck to a predetermined path, missing the surprises of Eggers' past films."
What you’ll get is neither the bold weirdness of Eggers’s previous efforts in the critically-acclaimed margins nor a clean strike into the blockbuster mainstream.
"The Northman is signature Eggers, with an almost maniacal dedication to period authenticity, big themes and some surrealist and supernatural touches."
"""The Northman"" is a sweeping epic driven by blood and brutality, offering up a bleak and unrelenting take on the legend that inspired it. It might be great - hell, it almost certainly IS great - but sadly, it left me behind."
"This is teenager cinema par excellence, an opera of old-world mayhem fit for Beavis and Butthead."
"Eggers take a predictable revenge tale and makes it his own, especially early on. Definitely a slow-burn that builds effectively with assured, confident direction that also asks for patience. Visually, it's one of the best of the year."
Its better than most of the current movies in its weight class but its less than that of which we know Eggers is capable.
"I would say it's one of my favorite movies of the year, but it's really one of my favorite experiences of the year."
"A rude, bloody, hyper-violent Viking saga like nothing you’ve ever seen."
"Through it all, Egger pulls excellent performances from his cast, maintains a steady forceful tone and drives the storylines to a cataclysmic ending. Try as you may, you can’t take your eyes off the screen."
"If anyone is victorious, it's the viewer of this immersive saga, who will emerge wobbly-legged, dazed and probably a little more appreciative of the relative tameness of modern life."
"Pure cinematic bliss. Great performances, a blood-soaked revenge story and Karin Blaschke' gorgeous shots - all amazing. Full review in Spanish"
"To prepare for this role, Alexander Skarsgård has bulked up to superhero proportions. A mass of muscle with a weapon in each hand, hes a terrifying prospect."
"Robert Eggers has a unique conception for the film, and he's guided his actors and technical team to bring it to the screen with extreme vividness."
Will sure tickle those that have come to expect nothing less from a filmmaker unafraid to be bold and gorgeously weird.
"A sweeping tale of laser-focused retribution, woven into the alien tapestry of ancient Nordic myth."
"An incredibly well-made and well-acted film with some spectacular attention to detail, but the slight story and Skarsgard's stoic performance undermines Eggers' technical achievements."
"Eggers recreated, with obsessive accuracy, the world of the medievals in order to lower us into a myth that feels primordial and strange, as if it’s tapping into something in the back of our minds that we’ve always known but half forgotten."
'The Northman' may not be your kind of movie. Eggers does not seem to care whether or not the violence offends you. His purpose is to showcase a brutal time when life and death meant less than today.
"With his third feature film The Northman, Robert Eggers delivers brutal violence with gorgeous cinematography that entrances the viewer from beginning to end."
"A sublime technical feat with no emotional core. Eggers doesn't offer anything new or subversive to the Hamlet tale, including its discussion on masculinity. Skarsgård feels miscast (or perhaps Anleth is just boring?)"
It's all very bleak and cruel. And stylistically intoxicating.
"Robert Eggers delivers exactly what youd expect from the filmmaker. However unlike his previous projects, THE NORTHMAN may be the most straightforward film, but it still veers into the weird realm."
Where the movie goes south is in its narrative and characters. Beneath the twisting Scandinavian folklore is a simple and familiar revenge story that never gives us real reason to care.
Its easy to get lost in time during those two hours.
"It certainly feels authentic -- there’s a sense of constant otherness to what we experience on the screen, yet with no sense of contrivance -- and that’s what matters. Everything feels strange, savage, implacably other."
The Northman is a well-realized film full of action and an easy-to-understand story that might not be for everyone.
"The Northman isn’t exactly a triumph, but with its many knockout moments, it represents a big step forward for the youngish director Robert Eggers, who for the first time has a big budget to work with."
"The tamest Eggers film yet. Lacking in the depth department, but fantastic looking."
The Northman is a sight to behold and the work of a director who has cemented his ability to transport audiences into worlds inhabited by the strange
"Eggers has quickly established himself as an auteur with a specific voice, and The Northman proves that having a bigger budget only enhances his strengths."
"It is a visually stunning, breathlessly violent, bone-crushingly metal take on Viking legend."
"The Northman doesnt offer anything new narratively, but it may be the most vicious movie to hit cinemas this year and its certainly one of the most beautifully shot."
"Iceland's hottest new club is ""The Northman."" Located at the Gates of Hel, this place has everything."
You never would accuse Robert Eggers of being just another filmmaker.
"""When I was an hour into the film, I thought how Eggers could have just gone ahead and taken on Conan. But by the end, I was pulled into Eggers grander, more complex vision."""
"Not unlike parts of Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds,"" ""Django Unchained,"" and the ""Kill Bill"" opus, the filmmakers build the tension with a nerve-rattling, deliberate pace and often make you think you're seeing something that is merely implied."
"Few mainstream films are allowed to be this bold, combining hallucinatory imagery with visceral action. Eggers tells a Nordic revenge story classic in its accessibility, but fueled with a style that refuses to water down the material."
Genuinely amazing!
"The Northman is gripping cinema of the sort that we get too little of today, when too often a director’s vision is diluted by box office imperatives and the lure of four-quadrant appeal."
"Savage, supernatural and often silly, Robert Eggers' intense Nordic nightmare is filled with brawling, bloody brutality."
A beautifully bloody empty shell.
"While other, nobler films often treat vengeance as something poisoned and futile, The Northman asks us: what if revenge was a satisfying, orgasmic triumph of sheer nirvana?"
Realism and mythology converge in this grandiose and brutal visual spectacle that explores a familiar territory in the revenge saga genre. Full Review in Spanish
"None of the players should be blamed for the uneven historical canvas or the unnecessary length of some scenes. Regardless, if anyone really is looking to be entertained by stories of this ilk, I suggest a 1958 spectacle simply called 'The Vikings.'"
This visually striking and brutally violent battle epic unspools a visceral exploration of primal instincts and toxic masculinity thats set in the 10th century but still resonates today.
"Visually, its absolutely stunning, but the sullen tone of ""The Northman"" makes it a bleak, one-note opus."
"The Northman"" offers elaborately staged hatred and death. It was popular then; its popular now."
"""The Northman"" follows the breadth of savagery in savage lands. There is no escaping the pall of terror it reveals. Eggers is a master at blending psychology and cinema. He plays mind games with his most assuredly cowering audience"
"Visually gargantuan, thrumming with strange noise and even stranger visions, this is not even your grand-daddy's grand-daddy's Shakespeare - this is the bastard child of George Miller's Mad Max Fury Road and Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain"
"Theres so much more below the surface that feels almost locked away behind a fortress of sparse dialogue and explanation. The Northman, sadly, isnt as inviting as it needs to be for viewers wanting to explore the world the film presents to them."
"It’s an impressive piece of time travel. Eggers succeeds in conjuring up a world governed exclusively by blood feuds and territorial imperatives. And Skarsgard, who helps initiate the production, makes a magnificently realised Amleth."
"Though the film narrowly avoids being a contrived blockbuster, it still is not refined enough to exhibit the kind of storytelling prowess that Eggers is capable of."
"Robert Eggers has established himself as a master of mood and tone since he dragged us by our eyebrows with The VVitch. Here, he’s working with a much broader canvas and a sizable budget, and acquits himself astoundingly well."
"If you are fan of old-school epic tales of revenge, then The Northman is the movie for you. It’s a cinematic throwback that is a step forward for Eggers."
"At nearly two and a half hours, that may be a lot to ask for anyone hoping for a straightforward thriller, but for those willing to get invested, there’s significant treasure in store."
"Even though there's actually little going on here outside of a revenge plot, the movie has weight to it, something at stake. It feels like it was crafted by people with pride in their craft."
That mix of detail-oriented realism and wild swings into mysticism and animalistic combat isn't just a budgetary flex; it lends The Northman a thematic gravity that keeps it from floating off into self-indulgent silliness.
"The Witch, The Lighthouse and The Northman all reflect their director’s penchant for exacting attention to detail and hard-earned madness."
"The Northman is a lot of things—bruising, rousing, and often entertaining—but it’s not particularly complex."
Robert Eggers delivers a bloody good Shakespearean revenge epic.
"The Northman is not for the faint of heart. Its a haunting, bold, and brutal Viking epic."
"It holds our attention with unforgettable visuals and the sheer, raw audacity of its premise."
Think you know what a Viking is? You have no idea.
"For all its physicality, The Northman (like Eggers’ other tales) hinges on emotion and superstition."
"The Northman is an epic saga of revenge...unflinchingly realistic, deliberately paced and leaves you with your breath taken and your mind expanded."
"Eggers makes ""The Northman"" as crafty as an art film, as brutal as a slasher flick - two-plus hours of arthouse savagery."
"The Northman might be Eggers at his most traditional, yet its his best feature, which is saying a lot because hes created nothing but bangers. It makes me wanna run to Iceland and grow a beard and abs."
"A bloody, muddy, beautiful and sometimes surreal vision of Norse myth."
Represents a successful transition to the higher-budget echelon for its director
"The Northman has a limited payoff after two hours, and not even an unexpected finale saves it from averageness."
"Eggers exhumes the bones of a primal myth and arranges them in spectacular fashion, no doubt. But just as The Northman itself is interested in scrying meaning from old ways, you'll want to find something to take away here."
"An intense, brutal, and captivating two-plus hours of watching bad people pay for their past deeds. Yes, revenge is cold, but in ""The Northman,"" it arrives in a top-notch artistic package."
"Worth the watch for the intense, authentic period setting and grittygorgeous depiction of a legendary revenge story. Though the film takes itself a bit too seriously. As is often the case, Anya Taylor-Joy is the best thing about it."
"Not all of The Northman works -- some of it’s muddled visually and linguistically, and at turns it gets a bit too feral for its own good -- but the immersion and mood makes for a mesmerizing and haunting odyssey."
"The Northman, whether you approach it as legitimate folklore or as a testosterone-fueled Saturday-afternoon lark, speaks to the 10-year-old boy in all of us, with a loud and mighty Viking burp."
"Fire and brimstone meet rot and decay, yet theres ambition afoot here. Eggers deserves a great deal of the credit for crafting another startling, big screen vision."
"Eggers’ miscast, moody, turn-of-the-10th-century action adventure seems late to the Norse feast despite, or perhaps because of, its overserious intentions."
"The film feels oddly flat, mitigated as it is by the cross purposes of its creator and the studio that backed it."
The Northman envelopes its conventional swords-and-sandals plot with a vibe and aesthetic that is both unhinged and seductive.
"More than a little over the top, this piece of bloody eye candy from ancient Viking life is a tasty, visually intoxicating  guilty pleasure."
"“The Northman” is authentic atavistic cinema, a bulletin from the before times fashioned by one of the great natural filmmakers of the present."
"Its most notable quality is the way it refuses to bend its characters to the present, preferring instead to make them as alien in their perspective as possible."
"Forget fire and ice (though there is that, too); revel instead in arterial spray. What more could you ask for? Its AD 895, and times are tough."
"A sensory triumph more than it is an emotional one, this is nonetheless an enthralling endeavor, everything building to a crushing finale of senseless masculine bravado thats as gut-wrenchingly beautiful as it is tragically heartbreaking."
"Psychological probing is squashed, like many onscreen skulls. It all leads to a slog of a saga of slaughter."
"Lets get to why youre really here: Yes, Willem Dafoe does appear in both a Viking-era dog costume AND in his underpants AND as a disembodied head. Its all true."
"Its a rarity in todays IP-saturated cinematic climate that a director like Eggers is permitted to take this wild a swing, and even rarer that their major studio debut feels so of a piece with their earlier works."
"The emotional connection meanders, but the production and Skarsgard's physical performance fly sky-high."
"It offers us almost no quarter, and asks none of us. For that, it has to be respected. Not many big-budget period movies are this unwilling to throw a sop to modern attitudes."
"If youre looking for an unapologetically bloody and masculine movie with just a dash of eerie energy to it, youll probably dig The Northman."
"His attempt to juxtapose ambition with cinematic bloodlust is not always successful, but when it works, the savagery on display can be breathtaking."
A payback tale for the ages.
"Working for the first time with a blockbuster-scaled budget, Eggers can give full range to his feverishly inventive imagination, and the result is often hypnotic..."
"Instead of the roots of Shakespeare’s play, “The Northman” merely serves up its raw material both half-baked and overcooked."
Eggers manages to infuse this straightforward tale with plenty of his unique sensibilities.
"The Northman goes beyond just being another story about Viking savagery and delivers a film that is steeped in lore, rituals, and prophecies. Its brutal yet beautiful with ferocious action sequences paired with stunning visuals."
A brutal film made for adults that shows us the maturation of an important cinematic voice.
"For all its relentless fury and fire, ""The Northman"" has a remote iciness that hampers emotional investment in the Shakespearean heroes and villains. That said, its vast medieval-era storytelling is stunning in its vivid and realistic presentation."
If you want to see a cinematic spectacle of Viking violence and warrior masculinity - this is going to be for you!
Director Robert Eggers hot-stamps medieval suffering into a titanic work of art.
"Eggers serves up a Viking Hamlet. It wasn't as unhinged as we were hoping for, the plot is echoic, and many characters (particularly the female ones) lacked dimension. There's however justtt enough going for the film for it to have been watchable for us."
Its a film that sears itself into the senses via nightmares glimpsed in the hellish half-light.
"The Northman misses the thematic depth of Eggers first two films, but the talent on display is unmistakable and cements Eggers as a force of nature as mercurial and frightening as Amleths rage."
"A tumultuous, graphically gorgeous entertainment for our time as well as an ineffably somber meditation on our species’ seemingly inexhaustible reservoir of savagery."
"The Northman makes you realize that, perhaps, an entire life grieving what you lost can truly stop you from what you can gain. diandrareviews"
"Alexander Skarsgård slays as a prince dishing out ice-cold vengeance in the musclebound, medieval epic ""The Northman."""
"The Northman is an intense, nail biter that is going to leave a lasting mark on the epic period drama. With gorgeous cinematography and phenomenal performances from Skarsgard, Taylor-Joy, and Kidman, this is a film you should see in theaters."
"We rarely get movies like this anymore, with an emerging auteur given the time and money to craft the big-budget film that he wants to make. The fact that The Northman is as good as it is almost feels like a bonus."
"Its certainly a spectacle, for all its slower moments, but a largely effective and successful spectacle: by the time the credits roll, its hard not to be utterly swept away by it."
Quite possibly the first truly great movie of 2022. It might even be the first truly great movie we’ve gotten in a couple of years.
"Eggers indulges both the grand folklore of the Viking age and the commonplace reality that shaped it, successfully creating an odyssey that feels grounded in the actual demands of civilization."
"Eggers does not care if the moviegoing public comes away having learned about themselves or achieved some measure of catharsis. The film serves the internal needs of its protagonist, nothing more. The conceit is admirably single-minded."
"The Northman, Robert Eggers’ biggest and most expansive (and expensive) feature to date, is also his best so far."
"Eggers' commitment to verisimilitude means that he conveys every sweaty, grimy, bloody experience of the characters in vivid detail."
"A visually enthralling evocation of a distant world, blending history and myth in a composite awash in bloodshed and butchery yet strangely intoxicating even in its excesses...Yet dramatically it leaves something to be desired."
"Director/co-writer Robert Eggers has sought to make the definitive Viking movie, and while the film issues a guttural cry for theatrical viewing, it is built around such a basic revenge plot as to blunt those simple charms."
"Eggers presents misshapen children who grow to be fearsome beasts, these simple tales told through cruelty and magic that resonate regardless of the setting. Eggers is more comfortable shaping and molding folklore and mythologies with dark symbolism."
"For the first time, it feels like Eggers is relying on pagan pageant more than psychology to drive the movie, and the result is a seance that doesn’t quite spellbind, despite a sincere effort to."
"What’s perhaps most impressive about “The Northman” is that it hurtles through 136 minutes of musclebound, shaggy-maned mayhem without a whisper of camp or a wink of irony."
"""Northman"" is relentlessly brutal, but the violence feels appropriate for a world in which there aren't any rules and where ""social change"" comes at the sharpened edge of an ax."
"There is swordplay, soap opera style revenge, surprising nudity, a howling ritual and a fight on an active volcano. But it can be viewed as a blood and guts old fashioned adventure through the filter of Robert Eggers. Why wasn't Nick Cage in this movie?!?"
A hell of a movie and youre unlikely to see utter weirdness on such a grand scale anywhere else.
So many movies about Vikings never convince us that we’re watching anything but actors dressed like Vikings. This one’s chanting in Old Norse and Old Ukrainian makes the film far more persuasive.
"It's a brawny, lusty, bloody epic of big emotions and in-your-face intensity, a movie that happens TO you as you're watching it, both visually and aurally."
"Hypocrisy is by no means fatal, but despite a glorious climactic duel on a lava-drenched volcano, The Northman leaves weary familiarity in its wake."
"The Northman is an excellent, unflinching, and immersive vision from filmmaker Robert Eggers."
"""The Northman"" feels like the culmination of Eggers' powers as a writer and director, taking his knack for creating moody atmosphere and his gift for words and staging them on an epic canvas."
...made with blistering cinematic vision.
"Visually stunning and painstakingly choreographed, The Northman perfectly measures up to its epic expectations."
"With his remarkable attention to folkloric detail, filmmaker Robert Eggers takes on Viking mythology in this bloodthirsty meditation on revenge."
"Once ... the underlying ideas about revenge come into sharper focus, the filmmakers don't develop those..."
"If this is how we get our big screen Sword & Sorcery revival, with inward seeking filmmakers taking a stab at arguably the most externally pleasurable genre, sign me up."
"The mood, the detail and the look of this production is extraordinary. And the fiery showdown at the end is incomparable."
"A wild and trippy ride, big, mythic, violent, and wonderful. Eggers once again proves that hes not only a filmmaker with his own crazy and specific vision, but that he has the skills to pull it off."
"Its a familiar story of payback, violent, visceral and vengeance-filled, but Robert Eggers singular vision, and fondness for ancient symbolism and psychedelia, make it a unique experience."
Hypnotic visuals with a bland story.
"As is the case with Eggers, expect a fair amount of the supernatural and surreal to seep in here and there, but not enough to outweigh the meticulously crafted period realism."
"A monumentally bonkers, blood-smeared battering ram of Old World barbarism."
"Eggers distinct vision will thrill some, offend others, but ultimately offer an experience you wont soon forget."
"Robert Eggers' The Northman is an extraordinary feat of cinema – but it's also a bloody, mournful, violent tale of vengeance that is never simply academic, but visceral, sensual, emotional, and epic."
"As the central revenge plot proved too familiar even from this most distinctive of directors, I found myself only able to appreciate it in terms of its filmmaking craft."
"“The Northman” lavishly rewards fans of the swords-and-vandals genre, even if it leaves the rest of us in bludgeoned, bemused awe."
"“The Northman” fills out its widescreen canvas, carefully and meticulously."
The Northman is an extravagant and unshackled cinematic experience with a vibe akin to a rock opera performed at the foot of an active volcano.
"a deft blend of arthouse flick and historical drama, dripping with atmosphere and anchored by strong performances and superb direction."
"It doesn't just cut to the bone, it tears apart flesh, splatters blood in our faces and spits in our eye."
"More of Olgas strong character & less of the bellicose brutality of the male ones wouldve helped Eggers in his critique of toxic masculinity. Instead, his savaging of machismo is dampened by all the savagery he insists on splattering across the screen."
Sheer fun ride into darkness
"Eggers’s action sequences are swift and brutal, filled with the crunch of life extinguished and tossed into the bone pile of time. Skarsgård, hulking and seething, is a fine vessel for the film’s opulent menace."
"Still and all, theres something missing here. While we may understand everyones intention, theres no emotional connection with any of them."
Another killer entry in the filmography of a storyteller who cannot be contained.
"“The Northman” is both a dazzling display of film craft and a sly retooling of genre, a movie that delights in fulfilling certain conventions while turning others on their artfully severed heads."
"Equal parts beautiful and desolate like a part of Icelands own volcanic countryside, iThe Northmani is auteur Robert Eggers most straightforward film, making up in style what it gives up in the complexity of his previous films."
"This movie is so visceral you can feel it reverberating inside your body, which is exactly what makes it so delightful."
"An achievement for the helmer, but he's easily distracted here, working tirelessly to manufacture an immersive viewing event, leaving dramatic power limited."
"As unusual and occasionally off-putting as The Lighthouse was, it was but a warning shot for the persistent madness of The Northman, a film designed to maintain a sense of uncanny threat in every frame."
"This is cinematic storytelling at its finest. Drawing from Norse and Icelandic myths, it's also unmistakably Shakespearean in theme. While it's magical, mystical and symbolic, it's not confusing. I admire and appreciate that."
The secret to The Northman's success is simple: it delivers everything you could want from a Viking movie.
"Skarsgård has thrown himself into Eggers' latest with full force, and it shows: not only does he look incredible, but he's operating at the absolute peak of his abilities with a performance that will certainly be among the highlights of his career."
"Thanks to intensely committed performances, the keen lensing of cinematographer Jarin Blaschke and clear motivations that drive the plot along like a humming V8 engine, The Northman does revenge as well as anyone could."
The Northman is a cinematic experience that could only come from Robert Eggers.
"Eggers has solidified his legacy as a wonderful director and there are no doubts, he will be making movies, possibly even Oscar worthy ones, for many years to come."
"An inert bore stricken by leaden direction by Robert Eggers who, despite an obviously huge budget, renders the film with absolutely no sense of adventure or excitement."
"The Northman doesn't so much adopt the plot of Hamlet as dig beneath it to unearth the ur-story that predates Shakespeare by centuries. So while the tale's broad strokes are familiar, its particulars can vary in intriguing ways."
The Northman takes viewers on a magnificent adventure.
"A visually stunning, but vapid, tedious and exhausting video game."
Robert Eggers is a visual master.
"It is melodrama, and murder and mayhem and witchcraft; its everything Robert Eggers does best on the biggest scale, and its his best film yet."
THE NORTHMAN is how epics should be done.
"Around the sturdy mythic pillars of regicide-slash-fratricide and seething vengeance, Eggers and Sjón have fashioned an almost-original creation, a mud-and-gore-slicked work of historical verisimilitude spiked with fly agaric and raging testosterone."
"'The Northman' is a film that, in relation to subject matter, budget and lack of an IP, should not exist in 2022. Warts and all, it's a miracle of a movie."
"Once you settle in for the ride and commit yourself to whatever hellish vision Eggers cultivates, ""The Northman"" doesn't just subvert expectations, it obliterates them."
"Eggers doesnt compromise on the brutality and scale of his latest feature, creating a visually compelling and absorbing thriller. Combined with Skarsgårds powerful performance, The Northman cements a welcome return to the cinematic historical epic."
"Gritty, bloody, visceral and front-loaded with a need for vengeance, the latest work from writerdirector Robert Eggers (The Witch, The Lighthouse) is so immersive and authentic, you'll feel the muck between your toes and every blow across your body."
"A guttural, primal grunt of a movie that is all raging testosterone and incendiary machismo. And I loved nearly every minute of it."
"THE NORTHMAN is a wild ride. Its dark, violent, gory and very entertaining."
"At two hours and sixteen minutes, THE NORTHMAN moves quickly. I could not take my eyes off the screen."
"This is a ghastly, grisly, ultra violent film that is hard to watch, but also hard to look away from this visually striking take on ancient Viking lore."
"The Northman is well-acted, directed, and undeniably thrilling.  Alexander Skarsgård cuts a swath of bloody vengeance in a ferocious Viking epic. The film vividly combines a Hamlet-esque narrative with Scandinavian history and mythology."
"Eggers has what you might call a singular vision. Here, hes made a film that feels like it was beamed directly from the long-dead skull of a Nordic bard."
"It might not be subtle, it might not even be particularly deep, but it sure is spectacular."
"Despite efforts from the Valkyries and Odin’s ravens, this Viking action art piece is fettered to the ground by the demands of the studio gods."
"Once again, I can’t quite see what all the excitement is about, as the American director combines a sub-Shakespearean tale of murder and revenge with Viking mythology, shamanistic ritual and a huge amount of bloody Dark Ages violence."
"'...a mighty, nasty-ass epic of treachery, pagan horror and bloody revenge...'"
"300 meets Midsommar, and probably the most realistic Viking movie to date. Part ancient myth, part Shakespeare, part History Channel. This might not be a ""fun"" movie but it's a visceral experience worthy of the big screen - and your time."
"Robert Eggers' blistering epic 'The Northman' is a raw, bloody, and brutal Viking revenge saga that splatters blood and brilliance on every inch of its canvas."
"The Northmans unrelenting blood-soaked story plays out against a brooding, hostile landscape that Eggers makes full use of."
"It’s as ambitious as it is preposterous and, at times, ponderous – filled with garbled epithets about vengeance and fate that are whispered, muttered, or blood-curdlingly yelled."
"The Northman, with its vicious blend of blood and ice, feels like the crowning achievement for one of the most idiosyncratic and unique filmmakers working in Hollywood today."
A testosterone burst that serves as a visceral and audiovisually stunning psychological study of the toxic macho hero figure... Full Review in Spanish
"Brutally violent but artistically stunning, The Northman brings harsh realism and dreamy mythology to this Viking story that inspired William Shakespeare's Hamlet ... The end result is an immersive cinematic experience that is both menacing and magical."
"It is two hours and fifteen minutes of violent, animalistic ritual, a testosterone-fueled orgy of masculinity, a film so dark, dirty, raw, and hardcore it makes The Revenant look like Jane Austen."
"Coming as a follow-up to The Witch and The Lighthouse, this 90 million effort packs all of that budget on screen while still holding onto the off-the-wall qualities that make Eggers a standout genre filmmaker."
"Director Robert Eggers' blood-soaked Viking epic is equal parts brutal and breathtaking, a truly immersive cinematic experience that makes the almost-140-minute runtime pass in the blink of an eye."
"It’s rather ripe for parodying, though you can’t deny the film’s power and scale as well as the beauty and strangeness of the landscape, in turn green and lush and black and icy."
"Although neither as moody nor wacky as his first two films, it’s another masterful achievement from one of the English language’s most exciting contemporary arthouse filmmakers."
"The Northman is everything we expect from director Robert Eggers  dark, surreal, atmospheric with a poetic intimacy for character building."
Metal as hell! An arthouse 'Conan the Barbarian' that makes 'Game of Thrones' look like 'Snow White'
"A cinematic wonder of Viking violence and old-school melodramatic barbarity, The Northman is an unrelenting and gruesome historic epic that showcases an absolutely berserk performance from Alexander Skarsgård."
"The Northman is magical, mystical and relentlessly masculine, but also, in places, perhaps a little too much."
"For all its virtues The Northman is an unrelentingly bleak spectacle, nobody's idea of a fun night out."
Robert Eggers delivers a masterful film about the power of myths to inform our own lives.
"You can always count on things to get weird with Eggers, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they get interesting."
“The Northman” is at once overwhelming and curiously uninvolving.
