review
"Frozen II may not deliver the same love and energy of the first film, but with extraordinary animation, positive messages, and our beloved Olaf, it's still a film for Frozen fans to see."
A waste of beautiful animation.
The storyline overall feels forced and clunky.
"The songs, perhaps not as compelling as in the original, still make the heart beat faster now and then."
"It's all still very fantastical and while it likely falls slightly short of the first picture, it's still a wonderfully enjoyable movie."
...a torturously convoluted extension of an already complicated narrative.
"Frozen II still feels like the market-demanded sequel we know it to be. However, it's worth noting that despite the parts of it that were more than likely the result of studio notes, there's still an emotional core worth appreciating."
"So Frozen 2's attempts to evolve may not be entirely successful. So Frozen 2 seems like it's doing too much. There's something endearing about watching it try, and stumble, and try again."
Frozen II is the heroine's journey Elsa deserved from the start.
"Frozen 2... is more mature, ambitious, and intricate than its predecessor."
Fans of Frozen may have had to wait six years for the return of their beloved Elsa and Anna but the wait proves worth it with this dark but empowering sequel.
"The whole is far from perfect, but the good does outweigh the bad like its predecessor. [And] human compassion reigns supreme."
"A bit lesser than the previous film and, perhaps blessedly for all the parents out there, the songs are not quite as catchy, but Frozen 2 does world building quite well and earns high marks for charm."
Frozen II settles with simply continuing its story. [Full Review in Spanish]
A pleasant family entertainment that doesn't reach the high notes of its predecessor. The spectacle and most of the humor compensates for a story that feels too convoluted and simplistic at the same time. [Full review in Spanish]
"The excess in singing in this film is a bit fastidious, but it does give the film a feel more akin to literature than something cinematic. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"There's magic here, and elemental spirits, but no magic and nothing elemental, metaphorically speaking. Rote and smaller than its predecessor. Even the songs are bland and forgettable."
"Disney works its magic again with a sequel that outperforms the original. The actors, the animation, and especially the songs - it is all amazing. I'm just waiting to hear 4 year olds break into ""Into the Unknown""!!!!!"
"Frozen II has some charming moments and the returning vocal cast are in pleasing form, but there's something unwise in separating the characters so much."
A gorgeous film.
"Beautifully realised, with a terrific soundtrack (yes, better than last time)."
"This first viewing looks gorgeous and Olaf is my hero, but the story lacked the magic of its predecessor..."
"I'm glad to report that, while it doesn't quite reach the heights of the first tale, Frozen 2 is a fabulous follow-up that both children and their caregivers should warmly embrace."
"Overall 'Frozen 2' was decent, but a little clunky in places. While the soundtrack wasn't as memorable as the first one, the animation is incredible, and Disney just keep improving in that aspect."
"The plotting of Frozen 2 is arguably too busy (and a mite too dark) for its own good, with a lot of chatter about death, mortality, tribal prejudices, and even alternate dimensions piled on for no discernible, franchise-expanding reason."
"Frozen II handles its business, crafting another solid chapter in the franchise."
Disney's hottest 'toon is back for a sequel that is not quite as magical as the first but still blissfully musical.
"As someone who didn't love the first film, I was nervous going into Frozen 2. Thankfully, this works as a better musical than the first, which makes it a better film."
A sequel that's entertaining but doesn't capture the clear purpose and power of the original.
"Frozen II often doesn't feel like a movie as much as a chess match, with the characters being shoved all around the board with studied precision."
"Frozen II is a sequel well worth the wait, as it contains an interesting and emotional story, has breathtaking animation, and even more catchy and fun songs."
"Going in, expecting a finely-tuned toy advertisement, and instead getting bonkers nonsense with some fine songs and Elsa ice-surfing, is unpredictable, and unpredictable in this case is to be celebrated."
"Enough about it works to give fans a reasonable degree of entertainment. Still, there's no denying that it's a big step down from the original."
"Frozen II isn't the achievement that its predecessor was, it's still pretty darned good. Better than it had to be, really...this new installment will likely prove just as beloved as the first."
"It gives us more of Elsa, Anna, Olaf, and the rest of the ""Frozen"" favs. But beyond nostalgia, it's ultimately a series of pretty portraits hung around a rather rudderless story."
Dazzling animation as the sisters' story - and this lucrative franchise - continues...
"Even better than the first Frozen, Frozen 2 is the best animated feature of the year and an impressive follow-up."
"It eventually lands on something that works pretty well... The first half, though, feels like the movie has to restart very nearly every single time it changes locations."
"While not quite hitting the emotional peaks of Frozen, Frozen II comes close enough...In all, they've done a splendid job replicating the atmosphere and joy of the first film while developing the lore around its cast of beloved characters."
Frozen 2 doesn't quite recapture the magic of its predecessor but it's a perfectly serviceable follow-up.
"Yes, the characters are still charming, and yes, the animation is stunning. But you know there's a problem when the movie includes three different sequences that either just describe favorite moments from the previous movie or straight-up re-runs them."
"It more than lives up to its predecessor's reputation, with an ambitious and emotional story at its icy (in a good way) heart; and 90 minutes of rollicking Disney adventure."
"Throughout it's entirety, in fact, the plot is such that you can see the grouting, you can see the screenwriting glue between the much-mulled-over ideas."
"The visual textures of the Frozen world remain sumptuous, from the jewel-toned forest to the foamy ocean waves that Elsa confronts in a breathtaking sequence."
"Frozen II is a worthy follow-up with enough heart, action, and music to entertain younger and older viewers alike."
"Not a make-cash sequel but a glorious ""Part 2"" of full story of the two sisters beloved since '13 by devoted fans of all ages, places, and genders. None will be disappointed."
May not take you into the unknown ... but it's a worthy-enough sequel that will ironically play strongest to older kids and adults who are spiritually equipped to handle its developing themes.
"Anna ends up singing ""hello darkness, I'm ready to succumb"" and ""this grief has a gravity, it pulls me down."" Like much of the rest of the film, it's a bummer."
"While it's interesting to see a Disney sequel borrow parts of its plot from The Fifth Element, of all things, Frozen II ultimately doesn't go anywhere we don't expect it to. Let's hope that the inevitable Part III is willing to take a few more risks."
"There's so much affection for and investment in the original characters...people will be excited...but I just didn't get the magic. It's fine, but Frozen I was so much more than fine..."
"[Some] sequences have a gleam and a rhythm to them that encapsulates Disney animation at its purest and most sinuous. The film itself doesn't hit that sweet spot that makes Pixar animations, for example, fun for adults as well as their children."
This movie is so confusing that even talking about it is confusing.
"This is a well-considered, beautifully made - if not particularly brave or adventurous - sequel which carries both emotional heft and an intriguing mystery at its heart."
Frozen II is an ambitious and challenging animated film that tries to evolve not only its own story but also the expectations for all of Disney animation.
'Frozen 2' is one more Disney film this year that has taken on some huge social topics and masked them in a story that rivets audiences.
"Your kids will love it. But if you're like me and you love the original for its depth and how well thought out its thematic strengths were, you will find this one sorely lacking."
"The songs in Frozen 2 are memorable, welcoming and fresh and its fun to see the Arendelle gang all back together."
"An enjoyable film, though Elsa's lack of romantic plotline would be more admirable if all of her songs didn't make her sound like she was trying to come out of the closet."
"Even those who don't will be swept up in the propulsive narrative, the sumptuous beauty and the delight of characters who love each other no matter what."
"But it's the relationship between Elsa and Anna that gets the main focus, as it should, offering the sisters another chance to forge their own paths."
"Frozen II is infinitely less transcendent and it is also solemn, leaden and of a feathery magic. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"So, not a disaster, but certainly not great either."
"The original was always going to be a hard act to follow, and although it doesn't quite reach the heights, this sequel should give fans, old and new, a lot of joy."
"With its message of female empowerment, and soundtrack full of earworms - once again written by the award-winning couple Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez - Frozen 2 sticks to its predecessor's winning formula."
"Frozen 2 just lets us know what is missing and, for a film that puts a lot of weight behind the idea of its characters moving on, this one clearly knows it is not yet ready to."
"Ultimately, Frozen II feels like a strong continuation of the popular Disney franchise. The movie reunites some of the best parts of the first film and still manages to develop and improve on the already highly tuned stylistic imagery."
Too bad Frozen 2 doesn't so much chart a new path as echo the one previously laid out.
"It's one thing watching the final credits roll to see the names of the voice cast, but by the time they detail all the people who worked on the film's 'Data and Pipeline Infrastructure', you'll be more than ready for the exit."
"Not only is the imagery even more impressive, but the story is hugely ambitious, allowing characters to deepen in some intriguing ways."
"A complete stunner, worth seeing on the big screen."
"Frozen II is not only visually stunning, funny and moving, it touches something primal and beautiful that few works of art can."
"Frozen 2 had some mighty big snow boots to fill, and it mostly manages it with bags of style, charm and positive messages."
"Frozen 2 lives up to its predecessor; in fact, it may even be better than the original movie."
"Tackles real world issues in a way that's both entertaining to children and palatable to adults. In short, Frozen II is Disney's best film of 2019."
Fun and entertaining to watch.
"Directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck take Elsa and Anna back to the big screen with Frozen II, a bigger, sometimes better sequel to the 2013 blockbuster - one that became the highest grossing animated film of all time in worldwide box office."
Imagine Frozen 2 without Olaf: Is that a movie you'd want to see?
"Funny, entertaining and doubling down on magic, Frozen 2 is a solid sequel that's maybe even slightly better than the original. [Full review in Spanish]"
"If you're expecting this sequel to be on the same level you need to let it go, let it gooooo!"
Frozen II is mediocre and unimaginative cinema. [Full Review in Spanish]
Frozen II is a sequel that dignifies and manages to equal or even surpass its predecessor. [Full Review in Spanish]
Frozen 2 is visually gorgeous but mostly a narrative retread of the original.
"While 'Frozen II' may not quite reach the grand heights of its predecessor, it's still a sequel that demands repeat viewings, and that's not something one often hears these days."
"While the cynical adult in me inwardly groaned at the prospect of seeing this film, my inner child was singing along with the colourful characters and, sometimes, it's nice to let go and give in to that naive joy."
"A friendly troll remarks to Anna and Elsa: ""it's never a dull moment with you two."" He's right."
"While making bold in-story choices continuing to break Disney conventions... leans heavily on visual spectacle and characterization, a safely world-expanding part two in set-up for the inevitable part 3."
"By no means will it reach the status Frozen had in 2013, but for those who want to play in this world again and revisit these well-drawn characters, it could have been much worse."
"Although Frozen 2 is enjoyable enough to watch, it lacks the catchiness of its predecessor so it is sure to both appease and frustrate fans."
"The more times I listen to Frozen II's rousing anthem Into the Unknown, the more I'm convinced of its earworm quality."
"The film has all the heteronormative family values parents rely upon to do their parenting for them, in a handsome package that also reminds kids to look after their siblings and pets."
"It manages to capture again the magic and charm of its predecessor, while offering us a more mature story about the hardships of growing up. Visually striking and tremendously enjoyable. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Frozen II would have benefited from travelling into the unknown a little more but it's still another big win for Disney Animation and features plenty of great songs every bit as catchy as ""Let it Go."""
Too much tuneless music & too little fun. My 6 & 4-year old granddaughters loved it. Other kids in the audience spent much of the movie squirming & wanting to leave. So did I.
"Walking out of the sequel's screening last week, the 8-year-old told the man in charge that she just had seen 'the greatest movie ever.' Meanwhile, the somewhat more discerning 5-year-old waited until she got home to agree with big sis."
"Even the dazzling animation can't make up for what's lacking, including the absence of an instant hit song, dry voice performances, and a mediocre story."
Disney reunites all the elements that made the 2013 original a classic. Here's why it falls short of repeating that feat.
I think it's a dreadful movie. A complete and total betrayal of the first film.
"As far as the story -- it did not move the franchise forward at all. In fact, it seemed to have a terrible case of sequel-itis."
"This is certainly the most beautifully animated film of the year... Unfortunately, the characters and the story get in front of those designs and effects. It's just not what it could have been."
"Another successful sequel for Disney, even if it doesn't quite surpass the first film."
"...one of the most beautifully animated films of the decade, filled with stunning visual pyrotechnics and incredible attention to detail."
"All-in-all, this feel-good film has some spectacular visuals, an environmental message, a couple of good songs and a family-oriented storyline -- what more can one ask for, really?"
"​It's a tall order to expect this sequel to capture the lightning-in-a-bottle magic of the original, but Frozen 2's stunning eye-candy and humour will be enjoyable enough for its younger core audience."
"Way generic and predictable, and sadly so. They had so much to work with..."
"Disappointing? Yes...but not terrible enough to be angry at the film or take it away from the kids that will like it...the artwork was there, there were some efforts put into the rest of the film..."
"The animation looks great, but Disney's unnecessary continuation of the story is merely a blatant brand extension..."
"Although some of the rainbow flavour appears forced, Frozen II is at its most persuasive when it sticks with Elsa's strange and unpredictable journey. Here is a sequel that didn't quite need to exist, but has enough evocative moments to justify [it]..."
"While ""Frozen II"" might not reach the bar set by the original flick, it's still good enough. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Scary Scenes, etc. - also Available)"
"By the end, audiences perhaps won't share the characters' sense of wonder and discovery. They might be ready to let it go."
"Stunningly beautiful with beloved characters, snappy tunes and grand adventure."
"Destined to make bucket loads of money, Frozen II is a faithful and respectful sequel that will delight audiences everywhere. Prepare to catch Frozen fever once more."
"Frozen 2 has amazing animation and great new songs, but also a muddied message and some continuity issues."
"Because the first movie generated such a bracing gust of enthusiasm, Frozen 2 will inevitably be nitpicked and judged against those lofty standards. Still, there's plenty to enjoy for those willing to chill out, and yes, let the past go."
I hesitate to say which film is better because they are different in story and tone. You're definitely going to laugh. Your kids are going to laugh. You'll walk away humming a song or two.
"It's what you expect from the characters and world, and it gets the job done. But the most enthusiasm one can muster for ""Frozen II"" is it's perfectly adequate, unlikely to create a seismic cultural shift like its predecessor."
Not much gain against a good deal of loss.
"Once again, stand out songs, seven new ones, and musical numbers enliven the journey."
"Anna and Elsa are back with new songs and new adventures into the unknown. Not as strong as the original, but who cares. We can all use a little love, light and holiday magic. Thanks Disney!"
"As far as family-friendly movies go, Frozen 2 serves its purpose, but you can do better."
"An entertaining and visually impactful sequel, ""Frozen II"" has some memorable songs, but ends up struggling narratively."
"Whatever anyone anticipated from Frozen II: Ice, Ice Baby, it probably wasn't a moral about reparations that warns children that their white grandpa is probably super-duper racist."
"Frozen II definitely doesn't surpass the original, but it's a great return for these characters. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The movie's Achilles' heel is that it's geared more toward adults than children, or it's based on an idea of magic that has more to do with the nostalgia of someone in their 30s than with childish curiosity. [Full Review in Spanish]"
In Frozen II climate justice moves from allegorical substrate to the centre of the story.
"Shorter on the character, charm and heart that marked out Frozen, the sequel can't give its high drama the same emotional intensity."
"The new story, which tries to build on Elsa's mythos, is convoluted and feels more invented than organic, leaving ""Frozen 2"" feeling like more of an obligation than an equal to the original film."
Frozen 2 isn't perfect but it's pretty damn close with a solid story and great visuals and songs.
"Frozen II has several delightful moments, but it seems unlikely that it will stay put in viewers' minds quite like the first installment did."
"At a little more than 90 minutes long, the movie is short but packs a lot in terms of a main story and sub-plots."
"For me, the best part of Frozen II involved fanciful animated sequences. The movie also hits the now-requisite female empowerment themes. I thought the original had a little more kick, but as franchise sequels go, audiences could do worse."
"The characters are sprightly, the songs tailor-made for the Broadway show they'll someday inhabit."
"Frozen II boasts a convoluted story with a few plot holes, but returning co-writers and directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee deserve credit for crafting a sequel that seeks to answer the most compelling questions left by Frozen."
Children will take what they what they will out of the message. What they likely won't be is bored. Frozen 2 makes up in pace and on-the-fly distractions what it no longer has in the depth of its story.
"Visually stunning and full of catchy new songs, Frozen II is a worthy addition to the Disney library."
"Frozen 2is forced to contrive new conflicts for royal sisters Anna and Elsa and the kingdom of Arundel. The resulting narrative is dizzying in its complexity. I'm sure it will be popular, I just wish I'd liked it more."
"[This] is a strong, richly rewarding sequel that deftly builds on the themes introduced in the first film and brought to thrilling conclusion here."
"A smartly-turned piece of family entertainment. It is also redundant, somehow even more than most sequels."
"A cloying, forgettable follow-up to a far better movie."
"Directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee were sincere in trying to make ""Frozen II"" as memorable as ""Frozen."" The movie, however, feels rushed and lacking in dynamism."
"The whole thing left me cold, partly because there's no actual villain and thus very little concrete drama."
"It would be understandable if Disney played it safe here, but they didn't. In fact, they pull a couple of stunts that will live forever."
"Frozen 2 might not win everyone over with its use of somber tones and darker imagery, but there's something to be said about a kid's film that shows how positive change and acceptance of oneself is something to never ignore."
"If they're lacking in true firepower, the same goes for ""Frozen II"": it never reaches the heights of its predecessor, but it's an adequate romp in the snow."
"If Frozen II doesn't look to be the cultural behemoth that the first movie was, it shows that there are still things worth finding beneath the ice."
"The ultimate lesson of Frozen II, perhaps, is that some films exist as one-of-a-kind phenomena."
"Frozen II holds on to its artistic vision carefully, honoring its characters and its world while fumbling its way toward their next destination."
"A few new characters, a new dress, and a reindeer sing-a-long aren't worth a 103 minute strained serenade of monotonous fluff."
Gorgeous animation and likable sidekick characters can't save this follow-up effort from coming in a distant second to the original.
"While that means Frozen 2 feels a tad unsatisfying immediately after you've watched it, in the long run, these complexities might be for the positive."
"While Frozen II is accomplished and delightful, it doesn't quite soar like its predecessor."
"The songs and animation are very good, things liven up considerably in a spectacular finale, and the small children with whom I watched it emerged from the cinema with no complaints."
"The good: The sequel is gorgeous and funnier than its predecessor and has enough positive messages to outweigh the negative. The bad: It's 20 minutes longer than it needs to be... and there's not a song in it that can hold a candle to ""Let It Go."""
"Fairy tales that end in the happily-ever-after don't lend themselves to sequels, and this movie shouldn't have been made. The good news for Disney, I guess, is that someday people will forget it ever was."
The links to the first film are strong...So why does this installment come up short?
"The irony is that while there is much talk throughout about the inevitability and necessity of change, the film only rarely heeds its own lessons."
"By my lights, Frozen 2 is still a plenty enjoyable film, even if it lacks its predecessor's subversive spark."
"Frozen 2 is no soulless retread but rather a much more narratively complex, visually inventive, and thematically interesting follow-up than anticipated. Its reach at times exceeds its grasp, but the effort is consistently admirable."
Is Frozen II definitively bad? No. It's the equivalent of vanilla with little charm and a heaping dose of predictability.
"An unwieldy mixture of Broadway musical, animated adventure story, and message movie about not only the importance of family but the evils of imperialism [that] lacks any hint of genuine magic."
The story is good. It's got good animation. It's got good characters.
Frozen II revives and doubles down on the good and the bad of its 2013 monster hit predecessor.
"Unwilling to let it go, Disney has concocted another magical musical 'Frozen' adventure."
"[I]t's not as good as its predecessor, [but] it's still well within the ""good"" range for kids, families, and anyone who loved the first film and is happy to spend some more time in that world."
In its more artful moments ... the film delivers imagery as memorable as any in the Disney canon.
Frozen II is destined to be one of those movies children will want to see dozens of times.
More of the same works but it is still just that.
"Frozen II offers little in terms of plot or music that will please either the adult or kid Disney fan, and will have audiences wishing they were watching the original film instead."
"It's never surprising, yet its bursts of pictorial imagination - snowflakes that streak like shooting stars - keep you engaged, as do Elsa and Anna, who still aren't waiting for life to happen."
"The animation is more refined, more realistic, and the story isn't a simple rehash of the first installment. Not a bad showing for a piece of pop entertainment designed for the whole family."
"One thing that really sets ""Frozen 2"" apart from its predecessor is the visuals, which are as gorgeous and awe-inspiring as computer animation can possibly get."
"What they bring to the table this time opens up the world only hinted at in 2013 and, in the process, offer answers to questions audiences may never have considered. By doing this, Frozen II becomes something braver, bolder, and, yes, more frozen."
"While not quite as fresh as the original, it still stands tall with its own proto-feminist message of strong girl power and sisters doin' it for themselves--and each other."
"There really does seem to be a desire to advance the story and build on the previous film, and that's what the best sequels do."
"While the visuals sometimes have stunning beauty and motion, there is little on screen or in the soundtrack that feels truly unknown, or carries any of the freshness of the snow that covers Elsa's kingdom."
The story is better but the music isn't quite as good...still #sisterhood and #findingyourself
"Frozen II opens this week in all its sparkly, sugar-coated splendour...it mixes some gloom with the glitter, though..."
Maybe the only purpose Frozen 2's narrative expansion serves is to provide a more compelling foundation for another sequel than the original left for this one.
[Frozen II] forces viewers to consider their own lives and question if what they have comes at someone else's expense.
"Frozen 2 is a darker journey, but illuminated with breathtaking animation and stunning action scenes."
"Frozen II is never quite as magical or affecting as its predecessor, though it is certainly engaging enough."

[Frozen II] forces viewers to consider their own lives and question if what they have comes at someone else's expense.
"Frozen 2 is a darker journey, but illuminated with breathtaking animation and stunning action scenes."
"Frozen II is never quite as magical or affecting as its predecessor, though it is certainly engaging enough."
"It feels rich for a sequel to center its thematic concerns around the inevitability of change, only to back away from that kind of change at the last possible minute."
What actually takes the wind out of Frozen 2′s many attempts at epic gust is its repeated failure to imagine and entertain.
It's hard to see how the same team who made something so cool in 2013 could deliver something so - there's no other word for it - lukewarm.
"It's definitely a step-down from the original, particularly in terms of the songs and how they're used. But Frozen 2 will please those it's meant to."
"Disney has, in turn, made Elsa into a gorgeous incel; a closed-loop of unfulfilled desire who soaks up the sister cuddles as an alternative next best thing."
"It adds up to a marginally more interesting experience than the first ""Frozen,"" but this sequel would have benefited from venturing a touch further into the unknown."
"For a film designating its story to be about a journey into the unknown, Frozen 2 is jarringly predictable, painstakingly toothless, and self-defeating in its mad dash to the end credits."
"Frozen 2 is a tale of two halves. Fortunately for everyone, the better of those two halves comes second and leaves you feeling mostly fulfilled when walking out of the theater."
It will no doubt amuse and maybe even enrapture its target audience.
"Props to Disney for spending six years ensuring that Frozen 2 isn't a mere cash-in, but an artistically finer film."
"If ""Frozen"" yawed toward fairy tale romance threatened by magic, its sequel rights the ship with magic bringing everyone back down to earth."
"Inspiring, but misses my heartstring pull. Those expecting a sequel to be better than the original? Ya'll need to let it go. What Frozen 2 offers is hope for future Disney Princess sequels."
"While the film provides several environmentally conscious nuggets to think about, its voyage into the unknown still travels the safe path."
Frozen II feels like re-heated Disney leftovers.
Forget the convoluted plot. The animation bursts with wonders and it's a pleasure to re-connect with those empowered sister princesses: Elsa (Idina Menzel) and Anna (Kristen Bell). Why is the sequel never the equal? Frozen II just might break the jinx.
It's easier to think about Frozen II as a product than as a film because a (sometimes stunning-looking) product is all that it feels like.
"Intimate but also epic, Frozen 2 is thankfully the adventure that fans deserve and will love."
"There's... enough jokes, set-pieces and songs to enable this film to justify its existence, above and beyond the needs of the Disney corporation's accounting ledgers."
"Frozen was built around an anthem to letting your emotions take control because no matter how flawed the results might be, it was preferable to sterile perfection. Maybe the people who made the new movie should watch it again."
"""Frozen II"" has some incredibly ethereal visuals (what they do with water is astounding), as well as catchy music throughout. It's good, but the first one was great."
"A sequel is almost always a lowering of the stakes. It is a very hard hump to get over. Frozen 2 needed some new stakes. Still, the movie is... okay."
"Woke Disney, trying to navigate a tricky representational path, steps all over itself throughout."
"Congratulations, Disney. Mission accomplished."
"Slightly darker sequel charms with catchy songs, messages."
"Despite having a collection of new ideas, songs, and terrific animation, I couldn't let go of the story issues holding this film back from greater success."
"Its messaging lacks the emotional resonance that was at the heart of Frozen, and ultimately, feels half-baked."
"The sequel is a solid, if not quite inspired, follow-up to ""Frozen"" (2013)."
Visually gorgeous but narratively slight.
This movie makes you not care about the characters as much as it probably should have.
"It rates a tick below the first movie, if only because it's missing the original's element of surprise."
Frozen 2proves it doesn't need to recapture the magic of the original when it can create its own.
"Frozen 2 is almost the perfect sequel. Despite some wobbliness in the beginning, this is a worthy and entertaining sequel to one of the best animated films of the decade."
"Whether you're a boy or a girl, I think it'll be an enjoyable movie."
"Frozen 2 may get lost in its own mirage every now and then, but when it finds its way, it forges some of the most powerful storytelling ever seen in Disney animation."
"Frozen II is a much more heartfelt outing than the first, expanding upon the intriguing Nordic-esque mythology and folklore of Arendelle in a magical quest."
"The animation is richer, and so is the conflict."
Frozen 2 steps into the unknown and delivers a sequel that sparkles all on its own.
"It's not a classic, but it's inspired in its own right."
"As in the original, the animation is luminescent, perhaps even more so with the autumnal colors of Arendelle and the icy beauty of the north when they visit. The story is smart and funny and wholly entertaining."
A classic's worthy sequel. [Full review in Spanish]
"Frozen II may not be perfect when compared to the previous outing but it's so charming and fun, it's easy to forgive it that. All-in-all, the flaws never bothered us anyway."
"You can tell that 'Frozen II' was fun for everyone involved in making it, but it certainly lacks the labor of love in story that made the predecessor so profound."
"If you loved 2013's Frozen for the songs, the characters and the comedy, then you're in luck with this chirpy sequel."
"It would be unfair to call Frozen II a cynical cash-in; there's a lot of love and affection in every frame of the animation, in every note sung and every line spoken."
"This tale of empowerment, loyalty and growing up and becoming a different person, is funny, sweet and moving."
"Heartwarming and breathtaking, but just mildly entertaining while lacking the freshness and catchy songs of the original."
It's none the less pretty damn impressive how resolutely the film commits to doing it differently this time.
"Much like ""Ralph Breaks the Internet,"" ""Frozen II"" connects as it should before becoming unnecessarily grim and psychologically dense, stopping the picture to deal with some PG-rated heaviness that doesn't seem essential."
"Despite this warmer tone, Frozen II is pretty much a mess - from the mostly unmemorable songs to the jumble of half-baked to outright bad ideas making up the muddled, complicated plot."
"Lee and Buck ramp up the animation action.... Lee's script also dares to approach the darkness of the source author, Hans Christian Andersen, in a way that's surprising for a Disney franchise."
"Even if Frozen II doesn't always recreate the same magic of the original, the emotionally mature, complicated sequel should still be applauded for attempting new tricks."
Disney magic at its best.
An animated movie that touches on royal politics and the sins of the past may puzzle little ones hoping for a reprise of 'Do You Want To Build A Snowman'
"Where the first film became a bonafide worldwide phenomenon, this bland, uneventful sequel does not contain one single standout moment."
"Is it as spectacular as the original? No, but let it go. It's still a beautifully designed, sharply written and toe-tapping piece of family entertainment."
"An air of wistfulness imbues the proceedings, building to a resonant climax that's hard to resist, despite some legitimate reservations about this uneven sequel."
The animation is incredible. Probably some of the best I have ever seen.
It comes up short when trying to tell a satisfying and fully coherent story.
Frozen 2 skates on thin ice as it fails to recreate the magic of the original.
"""Frozen II,"" by contrast, turns out to be a fairly typical sequel: overly busy and meandering, but sure to please all the young Elsas in the audience."
"It's a bit of a mess, but also a ton of fun."
"It's better than Return of Jafar or Mulan II (Kronk's New Groove rules though)... By the time they're on Frozen 5 when Anna and Elsa go to space, I suspect people will look back on Frozen 2 fondly."
"Great new tunes, a hilarious Olaf, and already beloved characters are powerful enough to elevate an otherwise clunky and frankly uninteresting story"
[Olaf] remains a beacon of brilliance as the film ties itself in knots trying to justify its own existence.
"It's almost a reparations story, really, which would be more touching-and interesting-if the sacrifices stuck."
Frozen II is a visual treat for the eyes that simply has no ambition to be anything more than an average sequel. Let this franchise go away if the only ideas left are generic stories with bare minimum character development
"If it all seems less effortless, more workmanlike than the first film, with a very complex storyline that will definitely be harder to follow for younger fans, there's plenty to like, especially the lush visuals."
"Frozen 2 never rises above mediocre, answering questions that never needed to be asked and creating a burdensome narrative to tie everything together."
All the things I was looking for and hoping would be good were good
"Frozen 2 doesn't reach the heights of the first film, but with more complex emotional themes and better songs, there's still plenty of Disney magic."
Frozen II sometimes gets impressionistic enough to reach the heights of its forebear.
Frozen II is a deeply weird movie. And I mean that as a compliment.
"Does it offer any further evidence to those who interpreted ""Let It Go"" as Elsa's covert coming-out anthem? Sadly no, though she remains an intriguingly elliptical canvas on which to project genuinely groundbreaking ideas about empowerment and identity."
"But just as Frozen transcended a tangled narrative thanks to its engaging characters and show-stopping music, Frozen II's plot missteps are more than compensated for by another suite of hits by Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez."
"With ""Frozen II,"" Disney has done the impossible: It's made a terrific animated-musical sequel."
"Frozen II is not as sharp as the original, as it suffers from a convoluted plot. However, admirable characters make up many sweet and comedic moments most families will enjoy."
"This kind of self-awareness can be a tricky proposition... But the approach mostly works for this sweet, diverting sequel, which understands... just how susceptible the audience might be to ""Frozen"" fatigue."
"It's a worthy sequel, but it still leaves you feeling cold. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"When your story relies on snow statues coming to life at convenient moments and acting out arguments that took place 30 years earlier, that's probably a sign that your screenplay could do with another two or three drafts."
"The visuals, as expected, are lovely, but there's little here to match the revolutionary power (sisters are doing it for themselves etc) of the first film or its inherent charm."
"'Frozen II' is visually glorious with plenty of amusing character interactions, but it suffers from an abundance of mediocre songs and a deeply generic ""dark sequel"" narrative."
"No sequel is essential, but ""Frozen 2"" makes the argument that, even in the fairy tale land of Disney, they can still be important."
"Frozen 2 makes a valiant effort to live up to its predecessor, but can't escape its shadow."
"What follows does provide a few big reveals for fans eager to know what was going on in the trailers, but beyond that, this is a film that lacks the heart and soul of the original."
"The only surprising thing about this film is how complex and contrived it is. It's nearly impossible to follow what's happening, and what motivates the characters to take action."
"With thoughtful ingredients in the mix, the filmmakers can't manage to coax out some semblance of a cogent, coherent, compelling fairy tale for the ages."
"It is a lovely collection of songs that are brilliantly realized by the production around them, but what's missing is the tangible genius that made ice castles out of pixels last time."
It's going to make a lot of money. It will also have millions of people counting the hours till Frozen 3. I. Just. Can't. Wait.
Frozen 2 takes everything we love about Frozen while taking us on a new adventure.
"It's fun, looks great and is sure to delight kids, but you're never entirely convinced about the point of its existence."
"It not only feels original from anything else Disney has released in recent years, and even stands above the previous Frozen as one of the studio's most interesting and compelling films."
"In a world where old-timers accuse the youth of being oversensitive snowflakes, ""Frozen II"" shows what it means to have one's heart in the right place."
"What's smart about Frozen II is, instead of trying to just recapture its past glory, it decides to be interesting."
"For all its feints and innovations, Frozen II knows its audience inside out, and wants to ensure every last subdivision leaves feeling both seen and satisfied."
"Unfortunately, if you stop to notice you can readily sense the efforts of the many cooks in the kitchen, recommending a bit more sugar here, a pinch of spice over there, bake this a little longer, put some extra frosting on just for good measure."
Unnecessary isn't always a bad thing; plenty of fun or otherwise enriching stuff doesn't need to exist. But a dire case of cynical sequelitis plagues Frozen 2.
surpasses the first for fun and adventure
"Returning directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck have done an outstanding job with this follow-up, giving fans more of the things they loved in the original film while expanding the world and exploring the characters in spellbinding new ways."
"With some impeccably-judged gags and two brilliant central performances courtesy and Menzel and Bell, the film feels every bit as spritely and as acerbic as its predecessor, even if the plot can seem like a bit of slog at times."
"There's a lot to like here, from a rich palette of autumn colors to a potentially provocative subplot about historical sins, but this is a sequel that exists not because there was more story to be told but because there was more money to be made."
"It's an entertaining revival, though a thaw is beginning to set in."
"While a joyful noise is being made unto the fjord yeti again and the sisters still rule, ""Frozen 2"" doesn't have the same pizzazz as the original."
"A powerhouse movie that will delight fans of the first, and win over new fans too. The third act has to be seen to be believed!"
The sequel lives up to the incredibly large hype that's surrounding it.
The sequel to the 2013 hit has all the elements of the original but ends up as less than the sum of its parts.
"Frozen 2 dives into the unknown backstory of Anna and Elsa with new characters, new songs, and all the feels. Frozen 2 is sure to be an even bigger hit than Frozen was."
"With its eye-popping animation, world-building, and character exploration, Frozen II is nominally a slight improvement on its predecessor."
"The sequel is not only better than the 2013 original, but it also improves the original film by adding to its mythology and shining a light on the events of that story in a whole new way."
"With beautiful animation, a soulful story, and incredible music, Frozen II is the must-see movie for families this year. Don't be afraid to go into the unknown with a different storyline."
A satisfying but very familiar retread of the first movie.
"Frozen 2 will satisfy fans of the original as it offers big laughs and even bigger songs, and if it doesn't quite match the original, it comes very, very close."
Frozen 2 is a more mature and empowering sequel that brings plenty of laughs and catchy songs as it stands toe-to-toe with the original.
"A worthy follow up with a deeper mythology, a bigger scope, and some great character moments."
