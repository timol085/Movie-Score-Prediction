review
"The protagonists are likable, have charismatic chemistry, and are portrayed brilliantly. You will love to hate the well crafted antagonist who creates obstacles for our leads."
"To quote Howard Hawks, Mangold's greatest influence, ""they're moving pictures, let's make em' move!"""
"The dramatic work of Matt Damon and Christian Bale, the well-developed characters, and the good soundtrack make a film that one can recommend. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Even if it speeds around familiar corners as many similar movies, Ford v Ferrari is a winner."
"... the film has its adrenaline-rushing moments, focusing firmly on the personalities of the ones involved. Yet, on the other hand, I found the car racing scenes way too repetitive."
"It's an exhilarating, roaring romp. And you don't think about what its glimpse of the past says about our present culture until long after it's already said it."
"Between its action sequences, its period flourishes, its use of music and its finely tuned sense of humor, it is - from green to checkers - one of the most highly entertaining Oscar hopefuls you're bound to see this year."
"Ford v Ferrari features Christian Bale doing wonders as race-car driver Ken Miles. You get the lean, hollow-cheeked Bale this time, who just by tilting his head one way or the other can seem amused, curious, satirical, or royally pissed off."
"[Ford v Ferrari] may relish in the high life, but its final moments feel devastatingly hollow."
This might be may all time favorite car movie.
"Two powerhouse movie stars, a director flexing in the midst of his prime, and an interesting story told in a flashy-but-substantive manner."
"a highly entertaining battle between the office executives for whom image and marketing is everything and the grease-under-their-fingernails designers, engineers, and drivers for whom the thrill of the drive is everything"
"A blend of thrilling action and nuanced character study, with a great big dollop of emotion."
"A complete surprise as racing movies don't usually connect with me. But thankfully, Ford v Ferrari is more about the human story than the cars."
"Quick wit, dry dialogue and grace notes punctuate bursts of velocity. Big themes sound."
An entertaining film that captures the corporate world better than the racing one.
'Ford v. Ferrari' is a thrilling look an automobile design and racing history.
"Ford v Ferrari rockets across the finish line using a flawed blueprint -- there's fun to be had, but it's all in service to the people who least deserve recognition."
An entertaining movie that doesn't let the dramatic touch be diluted among all the car races. [Full Review in Spanish]
"The races are exciting, with close finishes, spinouts, crashes and fires. The acting is excellent, with Damon and Bale turning in some of their best-ever performances."
"The race-car drama, ""Ford v. Ferrari,"" has more under the hood than hot rods and hunky men."
"Maybe you've seen the trailer for the new racing drama Ford v Ferrari. Maybe you thought to yourself, ""Looks pretty good, but I'll catch it on Netflix."" This is me getting down on my knees and begging you not to do that."
"Sure, it's a 'true story,' but everything is so streamlined and polished for a mass audience that I don't believe a minute of it."
"While Ford v. Ferrari finishes first on a technical level, it serves as a myopic altar to a sport and era of white-male dominance."
'Ford v Ferrari' is a great ride.
"If Rush was a movie about men who raced cars, this one is as much about the cars as the characters. In fact, the Ford GT40 emerges as such a prominent player that it wouldn't be surprising if Fox mounted a Supporting Actor Oscar campaign on its behalf."
"...awfully hung up on the often-sweaty guys and the much-fetishised cars - but, well, of course it is, and what did you expect? And at 152 minutes it's way too damn long, meaning that by the end it won't just be the vehicles that need a grease..."
You see the concentration. You see the sweat. You see the danger. You see the madness.
It's got a lot of character in there...very much a crowd-pleasing movie that's not thin or cheap.
"This is a blockbuster movie, but it's not shallow."
Ford v Ferrari is a little too long; some scenes leave unnecessary skidmark trails. But the movie still has amiable style and energy to spare. It's fast but never furious.
"Watching Ken Miles race is pure pleasure, but in the end, the film's clumsily drawn conflict feels more assembly-line than artisanal."
When it concentrates on aspects of American exceptionalism -- the personal appreciation of how America once thought itself great -- it reminds viewers of what pundits and anti-American politicians would have us forget.
"Think Iron Man and Captain America, only it's a (mostly) true story and what's at stake is not the fate of the universe, nor even an auto race, but the glorious, endless pursuit of perfection."
"It helps that the two buddies who are rivals and friends are played by Matt Damon and Christian Bale, who both deliver electrifying performances."
The chemistry between the actors is what keeps the film going throughout the running time. Director James Mangold does a great job balancing the emotional moments with the faced-paced racing set pieces.
"It all works out in the end as Damon, Bale and white-knuckle racing make up for any shortcomings making ""Ford v Ferrari"" an enjoyable turn around the track."
"In the small emotions and small moments of Ford v Ferrari, Mangold creates a film that earns must-watch status. It's rare that a movie can so wholly appeal to audiences."
"Possibly cinema history's first car-design procedural, and as long as it stays there, it's pretty satisfying."
"Ford V Ferrari is one of the best movies I've seen this year, and for someone who has little interest in cars besides minivans and SUVs, that's saying a lot."
"Just like the race cars produced by its namesakes, Ford v. Ferrari is sleek and fast; a powerful and expensive machine."
Find a big screen with a great sound system...James Mangold may be one of the most underrated directors working today.
"A supremely well-balanced combination of corporate rivalry, on-track competitiveness and human drama."
"James Mangold's latest is a revved up, rip-roaring blast that tells an epic tale in intimate terms while also delivering truly exhilarating racing sequences."
You don't need to be a car fanatic to enjoy this film.
"The staging is always tight, and the editing allows the two and a half hours to fly by. [Full review in Spanish]"
"If you let it take you along on an entertaining, semi-predictable ride with interesting characters and style to spare, you'll have a good time. Certainly, the movie is worth appreciating for its performances and craft, if nothing else."
"In a film full of classic cars and racing, its Matt Damon and Christian Bale that you can't take your eyes off of in this story about friendships, feuds and American history."
Ford v Ferrari is a lot more than just a fun ride. It's a truly great film.
This is the kind of movie they made when Paul Newman and Steve McQueen were at their peak. Bale and Damon prove even in today's Hollywood talent is talent and can't be denied. This is just a wonderful movie in too many ways to name.
It is a beautifully controlled and assembled piece of filmmaking.
"Ford v Ferrari expertly captures the rumbling feel of being behind the wheel of the fastest cars made, along with the drive of the men who actually sat in the driver's seat."
"I just like to see people passionate about stuff. Like, these people are passionate about cars and racing and it's pretty cool... so that's that was the biggest connection for me."
"Overlong and a little silly, Le Mans '66 is also irresistibly entertaining, despite and partly because of some outrageous overacting by Christian Bale, who appears to have forgotten how to be English."
Director James Mangold captures the energy of the mid-60s period and the lively personalities of the men involved in this story. But the script is badly out of balance.
"This makes Ford v Ferrari a very good movie that, a decade ago, would've been considered great. Now it feels like a brand-new film that's already an antique."
"While the movie has its share of racetrack thrills in keeping with a cinematic tradition that began with the silent classic Ben Hur, it's the personal and professional friendship between [Carroll] Shelby and [Ken] Miles that gives the movie traction."
Mangold has delivered a piece of state-of-the art Hollywood craft that is every bit the equal of the feat of engineering at its centre.
"It's a far from perfect film, but a richly entertaining one, with a twist that only devoted petrolheads will know is coming."
Mangold has made a winner.
"It's still impeccably made, with Mangold distilling the story into two essential parts: the thrill of the game, and the thrill of watching people who are good at their jobs do their jobs."
"There's still lots to enjoy about the film, which provides us with two wonderful lead performances, exciting speed races, and car executives wearing some of the most beautifully tailored suits this side of Mad Men."
"There are one or two fine moments here, but the film never quite matches motoring velocity with human emotion."
"I'll admit I was afraid that this movie would be a Ford commercial stretched out over 152 minutes, but thankfully, it's much more than that."
Ford v Ferrari's final scenes negotiate an emotionally satisfying compromise between wish fulfilment and historical veracity.
"It's an energetic effort from one of the most underrated and consistent directors working today -- it might not end up nabbing Mangold any trophies, but it's a winning addition to his already impressive achievements."
"Bloated, over-long, and celebrates the achievements of men only as they live to serve the capitalist machine, leaving anything resembling actual human drama in the dust."
The reality is that we've seen Ford v Ferrari's formula several times... But it's Matt Damon and Christian Bale's performances that make this an emotional and unforgettable film. [Full review in Spanish]
"Thanks to Christian Bale, Matt Damon and director James Mangold, this exciting motor racing saga hits on all cylinders."
"Despite being very much about car design and the philosophy of race driving, it's a very human story that will win over non-petrolheads."
"A standard-issue sports film, that's well-produced and well-acted and made the old-fashioned Hollywood way with flare, heroics and cynicism."
"There's barely a scene in which cars are not being driven, discussed, designed and argued about, but somehow it's not the cars that matter."
This is a thrilling race of arrogance as much as it is one of high-performance automobiles.
"Even at two-and-a-half hours, Ford v Ferrari never drags. The story is rich and the acting is stellar across the board."
The cars do look incredible and every time we venture on to the track the movie goes up a gear as director James Mangold makes it feel like you are in the pit lane.
"Just as the Ford company needed Ken Miles, so too does Mangold need Christian Bale. It's he who gives this fun crowd-pleaser a little extra horsepower."
Matt Damon and Christian Bale excel in racing picture with a winning formula.
THIS is how you make a 2-1/2 hour movie.
"The film weathers its two-and-a-half-hour running time easily, even as it navigates a cheerfully formulaic sports movie structure."
"Hitting the screen like a shot of pure unfiltered adrenaline, director James Mangold's Ford v Ferrari is an outstanding historical character study."
Ford v Ferrari takes the straightforward ethos of car racing-where the winner is whoever is the fastest-and lays bare the egotism and greed required for such a triumph.
Bale and Damon supercharge this fact-based racing drama.
"In this movie released under the Fox banner after its acquisition by Disney, the theme is that of the team of industry pros, working under experienced leadership, fighting off the imbecilic & misguided directives of the parent company."
"This film has no ambition except to entertain, and it does so exceedingly well. That's not something I take for granted."
Films this good grab hold of your heart in their first instant and never let go.
"For law enforcement looking to increase revenue, the best place to set up a speed trap this weekend is outside any movie theater showing ""Ford v Ferrari."""
"Ford v Ferrari never delivers any real incisive look at its characters' motivations, nor does it deliver the excitement of adrenaline-intensifying racing sequences. We're left with something fairly mechanical instead."
Throw in plenty of race footage and you've got a film that takes the checkered flag.
Mangold takes Ford v. Ferrari out of the simple realm of the genre without entirely losing the vibe.
Ken is the story's hero. And it's great to see Bale excel in that space with some brilliant comedic flair to go with his trademarked brooding temperament.
"The movie offers, to quote Miss Somerset from Thornton Wilder's 1942 play The Skin of Our Teeth, ""good entertainment with a message you can take home with you."""
Even Henry Ford II gets the message here: Sometimes you have to go along with the ride.
"Ford v Ferrari is so much more than just a car racing movie. It's a poetic and emotional story of friendship, love, and family."
Ford v Ferrari proves that adult non-fiction dramas are still viable for blockbuster status.
The film contains some of the best action scenes on film this year...yet what stands out are the characters and how they respond to all the literal twists and turns in the plot.
"This enjoyable fact-based racing movie runs a little long, but it manages to keep up a good, breezy pace, focusing more on pure entertainment than on trying to be dutifully ""important."""
"Not every ""based on a true story"" film manages to be worth your time, but Ford v Ferrari certainly is."
A thrilling race car drama with an unconventional depiction of victory and an unflattering portrait of the American carmaker it ostensibly celebrates.
Watch the film for a glimpse of the golden age of car racing and for the human drama accompanying it.
I would watch Ford v Ferrari over and over again.
"In the narrative straightaways, with the drama and cinematography and actors firing on all cylinders, there's no stopping it."
"One of the best ensemble casts of the year, in one of the best movies ever made about auto racing."
"Hollywood formula will have eyes rolling when Damon and Bale wrestle on a tree lawn, but top-notch effects - particularly from the sound department - and a nice supporting turn from Tracy Letts (as Henry Ford II) keep it mostly on track."
The performances are electric.
This is a near perfect movie to me.
The racing sequences racing are exceptionally crafted...to create something so immersive and dangerous that you find yourself practically flinching and sweating right along with the drivers.
Strap into your theater seat: It's a wild ride.
"""Ford v Ferrari"" is made the way Hollywood used to make them, a glorious throwback that combines a smart modern sensibility with the best of traditional storytelling."
I bought into [Matt Damon's] character completely... The race sequences are terrific.
"Led by a phenomenal performance by Christian Bale as driver Ken Miles, Ford v Ferrari is one of the year's most entertaining films. It's a rush of pure adrenaline."
"If movies were automobiles, ""Ford vs. Ferrari"" would be an old-fashioned muscle car, a big piece of Detroit steel, gleaming on the surface but with plenty of horsepower where it counts."
"""Ford v Ferrari"" is a flawless technical achievement, helping to elevate a solid flick to a truly high level. In particular, the sound design is some of the year's best."
"While the race to beat Ferrari drives the plot, there is a moving human story at the center, one of personal struggle, of friendship and family. There are moments of transcendence and the poignancy, particularly at the film's haunting end."
Director James Mangold's Ford v Ferrari roars loudly and thrillingly out of the gate.
"Ford v Ferrari can't help but be moderately satisfying, its familiar heroes-versus-the-system narrative jazzed by some genuinely exciting motor racing sequences."
Much of the tenderness that Ford v Ferrari mines out of this precise portrait of emotional volatility is testament to how finely both the actors square off each other.
"If one were to compare Ford v. Ferrari to the two radically different types of automobiles cited in its title, it would without a doubt favor the former -- it does the job of getting you from point A to B in a smooth and efficient manner."
Matt Damon and Christian Bale barely scratch the surface of their respective characters... But they do enough to keep the film chugging along...
"Even beautifully paced, ""Ford v Ferrari"" is a little too much movie... But most of those 152 minutes are a ton of fun, a splashy look at the way obsession, skill and having each other's backs can produce little miracles."
"Strong in its form and elegant in its dramatic intentions, Ford v Ferrari is more than a race car movie, constituting at the same time the best compilation of race car scenes imaginable. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"If you love cars, you'll love ""Ford v Ferrari."" If you don't love cars, you'll still appreciate the big heart beating under its hood."
The entire premise of Ford v Ferrari can be summed up as: just a couple of dudes havin' an old fashioned pissing contest.
"[A]nyone who has watched a race, especially a long one, can't deny it can get monotonous. The same holds true for Ford v Ferrari."
"For anyone who likes terrific acting accompanying engaging storytelling -- not to mention fast cars -- ""Ford v Ferrari"" should just be your speed...and then some. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
"The car racing scenes combine simple but coherent stunts with a sober and delicate CGI, and the resulting spectacle is truly visceral in the way that it captures the audiovisual atmosphere of the track. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Ford v Ferrari seems to know exactly what kind of movie it wants to be; that makes it an entertainment that should deliver for both racing and non-racing fans.
"On the whole, it's surprisingly effective, the kind of film people who have no idea about cars, racing or the delicate mechanics of a small block V8 can still come away from having been thoroughly entertained."
"While there's loads of testosterone and roaring automotive muscle on display, the best parts of the movie are the tender moments."
"The film doesn't break any new ground, but some thrilling driving sequences combined with likable lead performances makes it an entertaining watch, even with a slightly bloated runtime."
Ford v. Ferrari hits the mark as being one of the best movies in its genre in decades.
"Pistons and torques aside, 'FvF' is really about friendship, love, trust, and risk. It is a balancing act superbly orchestrated."
"A movie that is just really, wonderfully, reliably good. It's a finely-tuned film that has all the right parts in place plus other car service analogies."
"Both as a racing drama and as an excellent example of the sort of movie that Martin Scorsese believes isn't made anymore, Ford v Ferrari is exquisite."
Fasten your seatbelts. Damon and Bale drive this epic and affecting high-octane ride to the finish line. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Ford v Ferrari is a too-straightforward retelling of history that's too mainstream, too dull, and squanders a considerable opportunity."
"Ford v Ferrari feels like a throwback to the bloated prestige pictures of the '80s, all the way down to its USA-first message."
"Whether you're a car buff or not, this story about friendship and determination is totally engaging, putting you in the driver's seat, pedal to the metal, at nearly 200 mph for a riveting 2 and a half hours."
It's missing a soul.
"It's a new and emotionally complex model of an old-fashioned audience-pleaser, with wonderful performances by Christian Bale and Matt Damon and a resonant soul to go with its smarts."
"Director Jame Mangold has created an extraordinary film with a powerful engine that won't quit, fueled by human passion and frailty."
"This puts us right in the driver's seat, about mechanical excellence, human foils, the nature of competition...without being lectured to, it feels organic."
"Ford v Ferrari seems content to glide by on the charisma of its two leads and the sensation of the race, filling in the background with your average biopic fodder."
"Regressive in both its structure and tone, Ford v Ferrari thrillingly finishes its race to the cinematic past, though it had to pump its brakes a few times to get there."
I do love a good car movie -- add to that the joy of spending a few hours in a cinema with Christian Bale and Matt Damon and this Ford V Ferrari face-off was an easy watch.
"It's a flashy, vroom-vroom wild ride with seriously muddled politics."
The singular reason to see Ford v Ferrari: the opportunity to watch two fantastic performers act their socks off as Damon and Bale prove to have easy chemistry together that keeps you ensconced in their world.
"This is a thoroughly enjoyable film with fine acting, directing, and good racing cinematography despite some arguably counterfactual scenes, like picturing Beebe as a heavy"
"The movie is slick and crowd-pleasing, a very American story of capitalist-driven ingenuity, and it rarely goes beyond its surface pleasures."
"The deliriously filmed races, almost in subjective planes, share the spotlight with the portrait of two antithetical and complementary characters. [Full review in Spanish]"
"It is, all in all, a pleasant surprise. Partly because Christian Bale and Matt Damon, the lead actors, are really good, and are supported by a fine cast that includes Tracy Letts in one of the best and least-expected crying scenes of the year."
"There won't be a faster, more furious movie this year than this automotive rivalry, at least until Ford and Ferrari stop fighting when they realize they both have mothers named Martha."
"[T]he film really succeeds in presenting a pair of friends, fighting over differing ideas but, ultimately, willing to fight harder for each other."
"Has the spit and polish of a top-of-the-line sports car from a technical perspective, but in dramatic terms it's more like a conventional model that's just rolled off an assembly line."
"It's a satisfying, occasionally exhilarating film, but one which is naggingly risk-averse, and also maybe one which doesn't bother itself too much with the interior lives of its characters."
"Whether you care about motorsports or not, ""Ford v Ferrari"" is a kick: both a rollicking true story well told, and a moving depiction of male friendship."
Director James Mangold (Logan) handles the character and drama of Ford v Ferrari well enough and knows exactly when to get out of the way and let the cars do the talking.
"Ford V Ferrari isn't quite as witty or elegiac as it could be, but it does have a pragmatist's sense of satisfaction in doing meaningful, enjoyable work while maneuvering around the limitations of an unfeeling corporate world."
"Beautifully balanced, entertaining and edge of your set nerve-wracking, this is a terrific film for all ages, bumped up by impressive performances and well-developed relationships."
"With a great cast, fascinating story and old-school studio vibe, Ford v. Ferrari nearly clicks on all cylinders."
"If there is one character that propels Ford V Ferrari towards a winning outcome it is Miles, who draws from Bale his most endearing and warm performance to date."
It was just so exciting to have it all unfold in front of me. And the characters were so well written and so well-acted across the board.
"This is truly a car film. It really goes into that the nitty-gritty of car racing and whatnot, but it doesn't bog you down necessarily with information."
It's what can be called a classic Hollywood production... but shot with the advances of current technology. [Full review in Spanish]
"A furiously entertaining, unexpectedly thoughtful work of force and finesse. James Mangold's latest triumph is big-blue-yonder filmmaking that observes the holes an obsession with the line of what's possible can leave and the ones it can fill."
"(Director James) Mangold makes ""Ford v Ferrari"" a multitextured story about imagination and innovation and the obstacles thrown at those who attempt to think outside the box."
"Stunning, heart-pounding racing sequences complement rather than compete with the character development, and the track itself comes to feel as if it's a living, breathing entity."
"A winning (if overearnest) depiction of manly friendship, with some pretty thrilling (if only technically so) racing stuff. But it doesn't see its potential to be actually culturally significant."
"Director James Mangold is at the top of his game, keeping a sure hand on what could have been a sprawling, ungainly narrative, keeping his focus on the two mavericks at the film's center, never letting the viewer forget that the human element of the tale."
"With a classic stamp, fluid narration, and an abundance of emotions, Ford v Ferrari seems like an homage to Howard Hawks' films. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Mangold's film could be seen as a metaphor for his own industry, Shelby a producer trying to protect his creative talent, engineer and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale), from the big studio (Ford) holding the purse strings."
"Even if you're not into cars or racing, Mangold, Damon and Bale still end-up seducing you with one of the best films of the year. [Full review in Spanish]"
"For all of the unlikeliness of it, 'Le Mans '66 (Ford v Ferrari)' is one of the most exciting and entertaining movies of the year."
"This is a captivating and thrilling journey...the dynamic between Bale and Damon really propels the film, with an impressive production design and gripping action to boot."
Easily one of the best racing films we've seen in decades.
Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies of 2019. [Full review in Spanish]
"The large screen fizzes with spectacle, drenchingly vivid in the night rain of the climactic race, while speech-balloonish close-ups of Miles are intercut, issuing the ""Giddy ups!"" and the ""That's my girls!"""
It goes back and forth from the epic sport to melodrama and from there to comedy with absolute ease. [Full review in Spanish]
"Ford v Ferrari is one of Mangold's most entertaining films-and that's saying something, since he directed Cop Land and Walk the Line-but it should have spent more time exploring the hubris under the hood."
"Perhaps it is endemic to the American capitalistic sickness that we are so enamored of people who do their jobs well; so long as we're tunneled in that, may we always be blessed to have directors who express it as well as James Mangold."
"[A] rare, high-octane blend of art and entertainment."
"""Ford v Ferrari"" is ultimately a story of the way human ingenuity can be subsumed by corporate practice... underneath the hood of the muscle car madness is a surprisingly radical treatise on the corporate exploitation of human labor."
"""Ford v Ferrari"" works as a stylish, enjoyable mash note to its era, and the need for speed and all that."
"Vroom! Damon and Bale bring engine-roaring life to this true tale of two racing legends hired by Henry Ford II to build a hot, fast car that can beat Ferrari at Le Mans and pit American crass against Italian class. Fasten your seat belts."
"The filmmakers show, very well, both the rivalry of the two marques and the excitement and thrills of GT racing."
"After Logan, it's hard to not wish for just a little more from Mangold. I'm sure your dad will love it though."
"With a staggering two-and-a-half-hour runtime, you'd think director James Mangold would have delved more deeply into the interior lives of its two protagonists in order to ground their narrative in something other than adrenaline and testosterone."
There is a jerkiness to the storytelling that stops this from being what it could be.
"Christian Bale may be the leading actor of his generation. Not only is he a master of the technical stuff, but he also radiates the great intangible of star magnetism. In Ford v Ferrari, as in so many other parts, Bale simply owns the screen."
"Mangold gives viewers the thrill of being behind the wheel of a race car at 7,000 RPMs, but maintains a steady balance between the technical and human sides of his story."
"Christian Bale and Matt Damon - Batman and Bourne if you will - let their hair down as two motor-racing legends, to the extent that the racing drama doubles as a buddy movie."
"First up, don't let the fact that this film is about motor-racing put you off. I have zero interest in cars and I loved it. Le Mans '66 is far too good to be pigeonholed 'for petrol heads only'."
Ford v Ferrari is so much fun it's almost indecent.
"It's behind the wheel with Miles that ""Ford v Ferrari"" becomes a well-oiled entertainment machine, a thrill ride with a driver's-eye view of the world's most exciting track. Everything that doesn't work is just a distant speck in the rearview mirror."
Ford vs. Ferrari is one of this year's best films and Bale and Damon's performances help make it a winner.
It's ironic that a true-life story about two innovators who pushed back against a corporate giant to realize their vision results in a film that feels so formulaic as it plods around the track.
"This is certainly not a film for our times. Drawn from recent history, it's a nostalgic celebration of gas-guzzling fast cars and the people who risked their lives racing them. Yet it's wholly seductive."
"Ironically, for a story about men creating outside the box, it's pretty formulaic. But there's a glorious, old-fashioned sense of nostalgia about this hunk of Americana that suggests director James Mangold grew up on the Herbie movies."
"The race scenes and era are recreated impeccably, but ""Ford v Ferrari"" goes on a bit too long (two and a half hours) for its own good."
"Aside from just being one of the best movies of the year, Ford v Ferrari unspools the greatest sports legend most people have never heard of."
The film dramatically overstays its welcome. It achieves in 150 minutes what could've been handled in 90.
"Although Ford v Ferrari slots neatly into the biopic formula, that's not necessarily a bad thing, as Mangold wisely chooses to focus not on the titular rivalry, but on legendary racing personalities Carroll Shelby (Damon) and Ken Miles (Bale)."
"While it does not quite hit top gear, it is still a rare treat in modern cinema."
"A fun, exhilarating and inspiring piece of high-caliber entertainment that roars with an artistic engine. [Full review in Spanish]"
"As sportscar racer Ken Miles, Christian Bale is a study in hawkish single-mindedness."
The characters' ego drives the fascinating journey as much as the fuel from beginning to end. [Full review in Spanish]
James Mangold's latest is a racing movie fueled by its terrific camerawork and two even more terrific stars.
"""Ford v Ferrari"" is what it promises to be, a blast from the past."
"It's sustained by the main performances, attractive secondary roles, a captivating plot and the best high-speed scenes that cinema has to offer these days. [Full review in Spanish]"
Cinema is no longer made like that. [Full review in Spanish]
"Everyone's trying their best, but the over-the-top cheesiness and painful predictability almost ruin the whole thing."
"Not only one of the best movies of the year, but possibly the best movie of Mangold's brilliant career."
"Here's a film properly fueled by terrific filmmaking and performances, along with the right kind of Americana."
Spectacular racing sequences dominate the entertainment value of FORD v FERRARI.
"This is a very exciting film, and despite its length, which Jeanne will point out, it's one of the year's best movies."
"For all the formulas it rides on, it passes and laps the one key test of any car movie. It fairly puts you inside cars making hairpin turns at 200 mph. And it brings that sense of metal-mangled death being a split-second away."
An old fashioned star vehicle and arguably the most entertaining film Matt Damon and Christian Bale have attached themselves to in the last few years.
"In this film, a character's virtue directly correlates with how wind-swept and motor oil-stained they look."
"Ford v Ferrari is a good, perfectly enjoyable movie, even while thematically, it's spinning its wheels."
'FORD V. FERRARI' is an anti-establishment American Western...with race cars.
"A mid-1960s corporate rivalry may not seem like the stuff of fist-pumping, crowd-pleasing cinema, yet the battle is sketched with such élan, all high-gloss surfaces, scotch-swilling intrigue and rat-a-tat dialogue, that it's impossible not to be drawn in."
Old-school Hollywood filmmaking that balances plentiful thrills and laughs with commendable grace.
"...an exceptionally fun, funny and heart-pulsing ride from first flag to last."
More comfortable than risky. [Full review in Spanish]
"This film has rock-solid entertainment value, confident direction, and strong performances from two absolute professionals. It may not be perfect, but it's a welcome viewing experience and one to revisit."
"The motor-giant-as-scrappy-underdog story may not play well outside of a certain Top Gear set... However, Le Mans '66 runs on a fine-tuned engine of technical filmmaking that supercharges its moments of high-speed thrills."
"No matter if you're not into speedy vehicles and sports movies: Mangold's film is a testament to taking on The Man - in this case, a Detroit auto powerhouse - and having a buddy's back even when he hits you with a loaf of Wonder Bread."
"An acting masterclass from Bale and Damon, 'Ford v Ferrari'proves to be the rare example of a racing film with far more going for it than just what happens on the racetrack."
"The story is interesting, the acting is great, script is well done and the racing scenes work"
"One might wish that it didn't feel quite so contrived as an award season vehicle, but in the end that doesn't stand in its way of being a really captivating racing and character drama."
"Ford v Ferrari will have you shifting gears in your seat, laughing more than expected, and possibly shedding a few tears."
"Between its thrilling racing sequences and underlying commentary, Ford v Ferrari makes for an entertaining spin on the traditional sports biography."
"Ford v. Ferrari is a people-pleaser, a hope-giver, and a dream chaser."
A full-throttle viewing experience with broad highs and lows...a major crowd-pleaser that's packed with amazing actors and brought to life with extraordinary technical skill.
"It's a film about pride-about being as proud of your own flesh and blood as you are of your metal machines, and about the craziness that flares up whenever pride gets hurt."
"It's fabulously directed, charmingly written, and compellingly acted."
Old-fashioned in all the right ways. Truly the type of film Hollywood rarely makes these days.
"Pure, unadulterated swagger."
"It stands with the greatest racing movies ever...But there is no doubt about one last superlative. ""Ford v Ferrari"" is one of the best pictures of the year."
"Not only did the movie not disappoint, it exceeded my expectations."
Gear up for one of 2019's best movies as director James Mangold delivers edge of your seat thrills along with the compelling story of two legendary racing pioneers and another amazing Christian Bale performance.
"It's a captivating and perennial tale of stamina and standing your ground in a fast-paced world, bolstered by yet another career-best performance from Christian Bale."
"""A likely Oscar contender not only for the performances of Matt Damon and Christian Bale, but also the execution of its heart-stopping races."""
Little did I expect for James Mangold to smash everything I knew about race car driving and make one of my personal favorites-if not THE definitive-race car films ever.
"An exciting film, well directed, with very good editing and montage. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"A phenomenal film about art vs business, and a throwback to old school Hollywood movies. A genuine crowd pleaser that also offers up some valuable life lessons."
"Coupled with its love of old-fashioned American style, Ford v Ferrari fully embraces its status as a throwback blockbuster."
"Let Ford v Ferrari be a lesson to corporate bigwigs everywhere; if you want results, trust those with hands-on experience and the proper qualifications. The same could be said for movies; if you want to make a good one, hire James Mangold"
"Bale is on top-form, delivering a performance full of gravitas and sharp-wit."
"So much charisma, charm, and a huge heart beneath its hood, that even those with a tin-ear for motor-racing will enjoy its tale of friendship and family in the fast lane."
"Directed by James Mangold, with a slavish appreciation of formula, it's the perfect movie event of the year. If that year was 1955."
"An extraordinary narrative tapestry, aiming towards a distinct and unique finish line that aficionados of racing may be familiar with, but most audiences won't see coming."
"We've seen compelling racing sequences before, but Mangold has captured a dynamic, ground-level gutsiness which lets you feel every bump jarring your tailbone. It's half an hour too long, though."
It's unclear as to where this story takes audiences unless the viewer is a fan of motorsports.
I will probably get a few digs from my friends for insisting that Ford v. Ferrari is not only entertaining but also smart.
"The film lacks speed... and can feel like an indulgent rummage in car-history ephemera, albeit a smart, colourful and certainly expensive one."
"The attitudes of Damon and Bale give the film a dose of energy when not on the race-track, and when the engines start revving and the cars start throttling to the finish line, Mangold puts the viewer in the driver's seat and doesn't let off the gas."
"A rare meet-up of film and circumstance that proves irresistible, on-screen and off."
"Ford v Ferrari is a somewhat exciting entry in James Mangold's filmography. Come for the car races, and some fine performances by Matt Damon and Christian Bale, but don't expect to take too much away from it."
"The behind-the-scenes automotive drama can swerve formulaic at times, but Ford v Ferrari really soars when we get to the track."
Has some of the very best and most thrilling racecar driving scenes ever put on film.
Ford v Ferrari is your dad's new favorite movie.
"No points for knowing who takes the racing trophy, or for knowing which version of Ford v Ferrari -- the half-smart business fable or the rough-and-ready boys' own adventure -- ultimately wins you over."
"Mangold's talent for action comes alive, though, during the thrilling racing sequences, and Tracy Letts is having lots of fun with his portrayal of Henry Ford II. Yet the overall production is too cautiously steered."
"Though a mite long, Ford v Ferrari is so thrillingly well made that it's only later, when your pulse slows, that you see how formulaic it is. But formulas are made to be overhauled, and this film has some fascinating upgrades."
"There's fun to be had watching the Ford executives clash, and the driving scenes are shot with real artistry and skill, but they're interspersed with scenes of true inertia."
The heart and soul of Ford V Ferrari is the chemistry between Matt Damon and Christian Bale as Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles. [Full review in Spanish]
It's equal parts visual and sonic spectacle as well as human drama.
James Mangold's talky American racing film sputters off track and bores the audience in the process.
"Had to catch my breath after this one. The performances are phenomenal as expected but the technical craftsmanship is next-level. The riveting visuals, expert editing, the sound design and that Marco Beltrami score!"
Two immensely enjoyable central performances and some of the best race sequences yet filmed fuel an otherwise standard sports movie.
"James Mangold has such confidence in Ford v Ferrari, the performances from Matt Damon and Christian Bale are so solid, and the aesthetics so good that you'll steadily get drawn in."
"Mangold's movie doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it sure leaves a pair of steaming tread marks in its wake."
"I wish it came in a more interesting, inventive package, but Ford v Ferrari is perfectly serviceable."
A full-bodied and exciting true-life story in which the men behind the wheels are just as dynamic as the machines they drive.
"Ford v Ferrari is, in a word, sturdy. It's the kind of airtight drama that could never be called groundbreaking or even original. But it offers ample pleasures in performance and design."
"This pompous piece of filmmaking is surprising coming from Mangold, who has found a groove as a director making very entertaining, yet reserved films."
"Premium, star-driven entertainment made on a grand scale."
The story's great and the racetrack action leaves skid marks on the eyeballs.
"Somehow, Mangold has made a two and half hour movie out of this rather dry-sounding source material, and most pleasingly, it's entertaining even to someone with absolutely no skin in the racing game."
"At a time when the nation continues to weigh the fate of its auto industry, James Mangold's depiction of the Ford Motor Company facing its first major financial threat transparently plays to nostalgic reveries of the industry's golden age."
"If you're in the mood for a series of incredibly exciting racing scenes, Ford v Ferrari delivers. If you're looking for anything deeper than that, this isn't the ride for you."
"It's a perfectly cromulent studio entertainment, I guess, but it's not about anything."
"More gumption than gravitas, FORD V. FERRARI excites and entertains yet also serves as a meta-analysis of design by committee."
"It's executed so sharply, with such artistic confidence and mastery, that it rises above its familiar structure to become a rousing, wildly compelling, and genuinely great racing movie."
"I imagine many viewers will be more than happy to be whisked away by ""Ford v Ferrari."""
"Who doesn't love a Ford Mustang? Ford v Ferrari touts standout performances from Matt Damon and Christian Bale while giving you high-octane racing sequences and solid supporting performances from Josh Lucas, Tracey Letts and Caitriona Balfe."
"Mangold does well to maintain a sense of peril as well as make the 24 Hours of Le Mans race something that's visually compelling and exciting, even to those not enthusiastic about the sport."
"Great-looking, handsomely produced but tiringly acted and inert..."
"The true life challenge of creating the perfect racing car inspires a dynamic, precision-engineered crowd-pleaser in Ford v Ferrari."
Ford v Ferrari is an exhilarating crowd-pleaser...
"Ford v Ferrari thrills by simulating the record-breaking pace of the cars on the tracks, but really captivates because we care deeply about the men trying to make the victory happen."
"""Ford v Ferrari"" is a cleverly crafted machine. Exhilarating in its construction, suspenseful in its execution, and captivating in its performances."
"A big, glossy crowd-pleaser of a film, high on horsepower, engine grease, and clean-sweat '60s masculinity."
"Ford V. Ferrari is a good ride, and a good example of what so many people are thirsty for."
Excels at evoking the sheer thrill of the race...and it's compelling enough in those moments to make the case that nothing beats the thrill of competition.
"A sturdy, old-fashioned movie, made from a template but delivered with gusto."
A '60s-set adrenaline rusher with top-shelf technical craftsmanship.
Ford v Ferrari hits its stride when it fully embraces the humor and the adrenaline of the film fueled by the performances of Bale and Damon.
"Mangold once more takes straightforward studio fare and shifts it into a higher gear via heart-pounding sound effects and music, and drivers' seat tracking shots that will keep you gripping the wheel"
"James Mangold's thrilling race car drama stars Matt Damon as Carroll Shelby and Christian Bale as Ken Miles, two racing legends at the center of a duel for vehicular dominance that steps on the gas and never lets up."
"The best sports movies aren't so much about the sport as they are the personalities, and these two go big with their performances..."
