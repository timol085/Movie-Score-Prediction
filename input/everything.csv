review
"Everything Everywhere All at Once is beautifully chaotic, wonderfully weird, and one of the coolest movies ever made."
The Daniels accomplished something wonderful for the audience.
"Michelle Yeoh finally gets a role this decade that pays tribute to her rare talents, and absolutely owns it..."
The genre mashup provides a fuller insight into the characters’ personalities than a straight independent film could depict. The multiverse is a metaphor for the different facets of peoples’ potential and makes their internal lives literal.
"Everything Everywhere All at Once will remind you of why you love cinema. It is fresh, creative, and will leave you laughing and shedding some tears."
An omnipotent being is threatening the multiverse. Who ya gonna call? Spiderman? Dr. Strange? How about a middle-aged Asian-American woman failing as a wife and mother?
"Everything Everywhere All at Once is one of the greatest films of all time. Entertaining, hilarious, emotional, wild, unique, action packed, & INSANE"
"At the heart of it all, we ride a roller coaster of emotions that are inventive, complex, stimulating, and raw."
"With such a low budget, it's almost humiliating that so many expensive Hollywood blockbusters can't even reach the heels of so much originality, imagination, excitement, and emotion."
"Everything Everywhere All At Once is a spectacle in the purest sense of the word. A sensory overload, especially in IMAX, the movie is a science fiction, multi-verse spanning love letter to family."
Delightfully disorienting and intellectually absorbing.
"""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" is a steaming example of visual, sonic, and thematic noise. Chinese propaganda for propaganda's sake. Vomiting all of the time now. Hollywood pawns."
"At a few minutes short of two and a half hours, Everything Everywhere All at Once nearly wears out its welcome, but as far as hot dog-fingered audacity goes, the Daniels will make plenty of new eyeballs go googly."
"... Touches upon important themes such as control through technology, media, food, and body while resorting to an anarchic and hilarious sense of humor. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The filmmakers try to load the entire weight of life, the universe, and everything onto their movie. This is too many things on a bagel."
"Michelle Yeoh proves that being a middle aged immigrant has no boundaries and she is backed up with the amazingly gifted talents of Ke Huy Quan, Jaime Lee Curtis and Stephanie Hsu !  The Daniels provide a supreme sci-fi smorgasbord for the ages."
"It holds within it a great idea, when one disentangles it from the hairball that is the EEAAO narrative. But [...] in all its originality, it telegraphs its message, instead of allowing this intricately constructed ingenious world to be the message."
"The humor, though, is silly and second-rate. The googly eyes, the talking raccoon, the pet rocks at sunset, the parody of 2001: A Space Odyssey—all those work against the cast instead of with it."
"Much like a hallucinogen might cause you to cycle through every human emotion and see your life laid out end to end — theoretically — this film has an ability to dazzle built into every kinetic, colorful, madcap frame."
"... This victorious though regrettable film, or whatever it is, is an incomprehensible mess, foolishly imaginative and cumbersome to watch and listen to. [Full review in Spanish]"
"... their Best Original Screenplay fuses science fiction, action, comedy, and family drama all at once. Genre jumping might be a better term to describe the Daniels’ creative mode of filmmaking."
Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert not only think outside the box but outside the multiverse as well.
"EEAAO is that insufferable child whose parents trot her out in tap shoes, then watch to make sure you register adequate amazement at her Buffalo turns and Bombershays. You appreciate the kid’s skill and preparation — but gawd, how you wish it were over."
"It's a challenging, provocative, manic, self-indulgent movie."
"Raising an ecstatic hot dog middle finger to the negativity of modern times, “EEAAO” urges us to free our minds and accept that it’s OK to be strange."
"The fight between good and evil, right and wrong, social boundaries, mental perceptions and a long list of etc.; will take place among washing machines and calculators (...) everything, everywhere, all at once. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"The Daniels turn in a joyous film, a party so demanding as it is exhilarating.    [Full review in Spanish]"
"Laundry, taxes and life"
Some seem to believe this movie is a philosophical masterpiece because characters reach conclusions such as: “nothing matters”.
"...is certainly unique. Exploring the idea of family, existential crises, and other obvious philosophical concepts, the film uses its quasi-futuristic narrative to delve into these topics in ways not often seen in film."
"Family is complicated, messy, difficult to understand, and what matters most in this fantastic multiverse psychedelic drama that at this point needs little introduction..."
"[Gives] us dildo fights, raccoon chefs, hot-dog hands, and muscular pinky fingers. In one of the film's best action scenes, [we have] a fanny pack. [Elsewhere,] two rocks with googly eyes share their deepest fears and comfort each other."
"A wonderfully weird, exhilaratingly all-over-the-place absurdist comedy, led by great performances and a screenplay that is as funny as it is moving."
Everything Everywhere All at Once is a film with just as many lives as we see Yeoh’s Evelyn Quan Wang wade through.
"A fun, frantic but unexpectedly emotional watch."
"Everything Everywhere All At Once is a marvelous achievement in filmmaking. The Daniels have created one of the best films of the year, and it is sure to inspire the next generation of filmmakers."
Michelle delivered the performance of the year in Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert's Everything Everywhere All At Once...
"Visually restless, thematically redundant and the rare movie to be both overwhelming and underwhelming. After only a little while, you’ll desperately long to be simply whelmed."
Everything Everywhere All at Once takes the poignant themes of parental disappointment and life regrets and is able to successfully wrap them up in an absurd and entertaining 2+ hours of craziness.
"Lots of movies and shows entered the multiverse this year, but there was nothing remotely like this one"
"Rarely has a film’s title reflected its contents so well. While may not include everything all at once, it does boasts a range of genre approaches stacked on top of one another and blended into a variety of combinations."
"A true genre-bending wonder with phenomenal performances from the entire cast, stunning visuals, and powerful themes, the hype behind Everything Everywhere All At Once is real!"
I hope this movie exists in every alternate universe.
"An exhausting, confusing, hilariously funny, pleasing assault on the ears and eyes from directors Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert."
"Never has a film lived up to its title more than this, the most bonkers movie you’ll ever see, equal parts exhilarating and exhausting. I remain leary of the multiverse trend of chaotic storytelling. It shouldn't be repeated. Let “EEAAO” exist on its own."
"...mixes science fiction, martial arts, comedy, fantasy, parody, animation, social realism, and probably a few more styles I’ve left out."
"Everything Everywhere All at Once is one of the best films this year. From the editing, set design, world building, pacing/transitions, amazing student choreography and some of the best performances this year from Yeoh, Quan, & Hsu. A NEAR PERFECT FILM!"
Undoubtedly the most creatively chaotic experience I’ve ever seen or likely will ever see.
It's the most original film of the year
EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE is one of the best films of the year. It’s a brave cinematic mirror of all the banal but critical things that make us and our lives important in an indifferent universe.
"Stephanie Hsu threw down one of the best performances of 2022, hands down."
"Delightfully bonkers on the surface, this inventive extravaganza from the directing team called Daniels (Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert) has a deep layer of family feeling and a well-earned emotional pull at the end."
The most brilliantly bananas movie of 2022 absolutely lives up to its title. Michelle Yeoh kicks all types of butt as a time-travelling laundromat manager in a multiverse of madness.
It’s an apt title—Everything Everywhere All At Once really does have everything...
(The Daniels) Kwan and Scheinert make everything seem possible.
"The explosion of creative storytelling along with stellar performances by the gifted ensemble led by the incandescent Michelle Yeoh, make for a dense work that should be revisited to continue to peel away the legion of layers that can be found..."
Everything Everywhere All at Once is everything you want from a movie and so much more.
…and in the multiverse Michelle Yeoh is everything!
"The directing duo, Daniels, turned down a Marvel offer to make their delightful new movie. We couldn't be happier."
"I can't promise everyone will like it, because it is so weird. But it's so unique I feel like everybody should give it a shot."
I've always been a fan of Michelle Yeoh and this was a fantastic showcase of her skills. I really liked this movie and was thoroughly entertained. The only negative is that visually it can be VERY overwhelming.
I greatly enjoyed this and look forward to seeing it multiple times to continue dissecting the visuals and themes. All of the actors brought their A-game and I hope this gets numerous accolades this awards season.
"It is unafraid of being cheesy and silly, leaning into the full potential of its marvelous vulgarity cut with a prevailing sweetness that resonates in a triumphant final act."
"The Daniels, through their quirky, revolutionary and thoroughly entertaining film, offer a winning perspective to our troubles: It all matters exactly because we’re small and stupid."
"A peerless ode to love, life and everything in between."
"One of the most profound and moving sci-fi films I’ve ever seen, as well as being mental and a lot of fun."
Everything Everywhere All At Once is the reason I still go to the movies! We've got a good one here folks.
"The performances are in perfect sync with the Daniels’ giddiness. Michelle Yeoh, at the front and centre of possibly the most memorable role of her career, is the anchor of a film that rarely stops once it gets going."
Everything Everywhere All at Once is an exhilarating ride and an ample showcase of rising and unrealised talent that embodies the beauty of the human spirit through the prism of the preternatural. It is one of the best films of 2022.
Michelle Yeoh pulls off what is arguably the best performance of her storied screen career.
Everything Everywhere All at Once takes a creative look at familiar topics by way of the multiverse concept.
"Exhilarating, funny and moving, their film is also messy, overstuffed and a trifle exhausting."
"Some of it is legitimately moving, and gets at the specific pains of an Asian-American family in a more lateral and artistic way than it might have with a more conventional narrative."
"Everything Everywhere All at Once is simply one of the best films of the year. Cinematically brilliant, full of nuanced performances and with incredible themes throughout. 
A24 continues to showcase why it stands as one of the best film studios."
"Whether it’s the draining exposition of the first half or the smothering non-stop ridiculousness of the second half, the film never finds a good balance."
"It’s absurd and wild and wonderful, and will probably make you cry."
"...the undisciplined product of a pair of spitballing concept artists, who too often find themselves pitching out of hiccups in characterization and allegory and embracing the shiny allure of the new whenever nuance become too much to bear..."
"It's smart, idiotic, serious, hilarious, sentimental, routinary, fantastic, complex, simple, easy, hard; it's done it. It's everything. At once. Everywhere. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Hyper-innovative thrill-ride... draws elements of science fiction, martial arts, family values and that ever-expanding storytelling device known as the multiverse, and then throws the whole lot in a blender."
"It’s up there with Mad Max: Fury Road, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and The Matrix, in that it’s a movie that fully embraces the spectacle and artistry of cinema whilst never forgetting about what really matters: story, character, and theme."
"A bit overrated but worth seeing for the great Michelle Yeoh in a very trendy, nth-degree multi-verse, live-action cartoon concept film. (Lionsgate 4K blu-ray)."
"Collaborating with a small team of visual effects artists working in practical media, [Daniels] have achieved a joyous spectacle as exhausting as it is constantly surprising. ... For all of its imagination, this movie's finale feels overlong and preachy."
This is a film about finding love and connection when you’ve been ground down. Even the bizarre hot dog-handed world gets to have its own deep moments that will likely make you cry.
The sort of movie Michelle Yeoh deserves.
"Outrageous, confusing, or confounding? Everything Everywhere All at Once stands out as one of the most original movies to come along in years."
"Everything Everywhere All At Once can be compared to many, many things, but one of the most complimentary things I can say about any movie is that this one felt like a live-action Don Hertzfeldt film."
"A phantasmagorical time-shifting multiverse explosion of kung-fu sci-fi. Chaos reigns supreme, with the screen ablaze with every trick in a director’s arsenal, like an immersive demo of sensory overload."
"It's a whirl, a swirl, a trip, a blast and a juggle as well and, in this universe, the Daniels wouldn't have it any other way."
This is the true virtue that catapults this film into an instant classic: It finds beauty in the ordinary. [Full review in Spanish]
"After maybe, 10-15 minutes of normal stuff -- taxes, laundry, family tensions -- this movie takes off into some of the most imaginative and just plain what-tha’-??????? territory you’ve ever seen."
"Not the perfect movie they've been hyping about, but a visually stunning feature with Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan at the top of their game. An interesting story about embracing the uncertainty of our own destiny. Twenty minutes too long IMO."
"...in Everything Everywhere All at Once, we enter the universes, the many branches of the central character, Evelyn Wang..."
"It makes good use of the idea of a multiverse, showing us the different possibilities of its protagonists, and confidently developing a narrative centred on the relationship between a mother and daughter, and a wife and husband. Full review in Spanish."
"I can't find anything out of the ordinary, except a boredom that is as infinite as the universe. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Here's what's truly bold about Everything Everywhere All at Once: it doesn't try to be all things to all people. It's a keeper, in any universe."
"The colorful thriller, Everything Everywhere All At Once, is a movie to watch when nothing in the world makes sense anymore because it reminds you of what it is to be human.
[Full review in Spanish]"
"Utilizes science fiction as a vehicle to approach its philosophical questions...or something more intimate like new ways to solve problems or accompany your family on the path that each one chooses.
[Full review in Spanish]"
"Almost, almost multiplies exponentially. [Full review in Spanish]"
There are moments when the title seems too literal. Exhaustion creeps in. But successive second winds follow.
"Places the adventure in introspective terrain, almost metaphysical. [Full review in Spanish]"
Exercise patience and a willingness to meet Daniels on their own lunatic turf...
Hot dog fingers. A raccoon chef. Kung fu. What's not to love here?
"An inordinate, overwhelming, frantic experience that is sometimes inconsequential and others irritating. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Michelle Yeoh's hilarious, mind-bending, existential crisis is exactly what we need. The Daniels knocked it out of the park with this unruly sci-fi adventure worth its runtime."
A strange and delirious gem... [Full review in Spanish]
A film with multiple layers that converge throughout an extraordinary story. [Full review in Spanish]
"Some of the story’s unlikeliest beats are also its most intimate, allowing Yeoh the opportunity for some incredibly nuanced emotional work."
One of the best films of the year. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Matrix, thought thrown inside a blender of slapstick and surrealism, tenderness and stupefaction. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Within ten minutes, the Daniels make a clear point: no one else in the world could have directed this movie. As they continue to innovate and break the rules of filmmaking, the Daniels have the opportunity to become one of our most unique filmmaking duos."
"The film has been billed as a science-fiction comedy, but it doesn’t really belong to either genre, despite the abundance of fantasy and the fact that it’s often very funny."
"It has been a long time since I’ve seen a movie that both transported me so fully out of my mundane life and made me want to hug my kids and call my mom and appreciate my spouse’s penchant for corny jokes -- in this life, or in any others."
"Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert's excessive, gratuitous, and puzzle-like film owes a lot to the Pythons, at least to one of them: Terry Gilliam. [Full review in Spanish]"
A historic cinematic event. [Full review in Spanish]
"The purest absurdity and chaos embraced between eschatological sequences, martial arts fights and pure emotion in a film that truly is everything.
[Full review in Spanish]"
"One of the wittiest films I have seen in a long time, it tops the scale of absurdities with panache and leaves audiences wanting more."
"Outrageous fun, even if you might not be entirely sure what the rules of the multiverse are."
"...the movie, beyond a certain point, adopts an often unreasonably frenetic feel that becomes more and more difficult to stomach..."
"A totally unpredictable surreal journey of pop existentialism and kung-fu, frenetic and unexpected: an instant classic. [Full review in Spanish]"
"An artesanal blockbuster that can supercharge the senses, minds and hearts of all your versions, everywhere."
"The Daniels fall into the trap of thinking that reacting to a thing is the same as engaging with it, or truly working to interpret it. And it is that sentiment that guides the emotions of the film which often feel too superficial to cohere."
The Daniels and their wow of a star Michelle Yeoh turn this visionary absurdist comedy into a volcano of creative ideas in full eruption. It’s like nothing you’ve ever seen.
Yeoh brings heart and pathos to a character that might have been two-dimensional in the hands of a less intelligent actress.
The fact that it delivers that message in a story that puts Asian and queer characters front-and-center is just another great reason to call this disarmingly oddball movie the brightest gem of the season.
"While this is one of the most intensely action-packed movies in recent memory, it's also sharply moving. And even beautiful."
"Carrying an essential message for today’s cynical, busted up world, it’s uplifting, occasionally heartbreaking, everything, everywhere, all at once."
"It may overwhelm lovers of the mainstream, but its peculiarity is also what makes it special."
No doubt I thoroughly enjoyed it in another universe.
"The result may be a tad overlong and convolutedly overstuffed, but it made me laugh, cry and think..."
"Daniels had a goal: reintroduce Yeoh, who is so gifted with nuance that this role hits like a ton of bricks, and give movie audiences something they don't usually get. A genre-less, time-hopping adventure film that manages to thrill and make one laugh."
"Those who do enjoy its delightfully unhinged cinematic style, its unabashed love of pop culture references, and its wild, multi-layered bacchanalian wonder, will likely proclaim this one of the best movies of the year."
"Filled with zany invention, but also a pile-up of puerile jokes and laboured attempts to be profound."
"More Yeoh is more Yeoh. There may be some awful universe where she isn't one of the most capable, likeable frontwomen in film, but, thankfully, it's not this one."
"Balancing its serious side with silliness and sincerity, queer-positive Everything Everywhere All At Once speaks to a communal determination to press forward, even when it seems the whole world is pressing back."
"Rich performances collide with big ideas, wrapped in a nuanced understanding of how we treat each other. And there are butt jokes. So many wonderful, dumb butt jokes. What more could you ask for?"
"Less devoted cinema-goers should be aware that while the movie is technically extremely impressive, often very funny and occasionally quite touching, it’s also an exhausting and overwhelming experience"
"…Everything Everywhere All At Once may rework familiar themes and characters, but you can’t say you’ve seen it all before…"
"Although infinitely more engaging than Daniels’ intensely irritating debut, Swiss Army Man, the quirk factor remains dialled up to 11 throughout. Nevertheless, it’s fun..."
"I’ve rarely felt more impaled on the fence by a film, because, exactly as promised, it’s everything at once – good and not good; fresh yet still a formula; cramped, strenuous, full to the brim."
"While not entirely without fault, you would be pressed to find a film as brilliantly chaotic or as original as Kwan and Scheinert’s film."
Bonkers. Chaotic. Wild. A cinematic maverick. Everything Everywhere All at Once is a rare treat.
"The directors behind the farting corpse film are now back with a trippy, wonderful and utterly compelling story of a woman drawn into the multiverse."
Everything Everywhere All At Once is the definition of a masterpiece and one everyone should watch as soon as they can as it’s the kind of movie that reignites your passion for cinema.
Hsu and Yeoh’s scenes together switch effortlessly between comically violent and deeply emotional as they eventually discover connection in the strangest of places and in the most surprising forms.
It's a mother-daughter story. It's a story about acceptance and rejection. It's a story about intergenerational trauma. It's a metaphysical treatise on nihilism. It's a comedy. It's a romance. It's a sci-fi action movie. It's a kung fu movie.
"The acting in this movie is superb and it looks great with its dazzling visuals, great stunts and elaborate sets. This is one of those films that really stands out from the crowd, and it will probably end up on a lot of top 10 lists for 2022."
"Come for the wild ideas, stay for the warm wisdom in the Daniels’ heartfelt carnival of chaos. Yeoh aces every curveball."
I wish I liked it more.
Easily one of the best comedies of the year.
"A great deal of energy and talent has been expended here on the idealisation of the family unit, and the quest for a United States that never existed."
"A pure firework display of technical bravado, wild invention, emotional storytelling, comedic genius, action mastery and outstanding performances, Everything Everywhere All At Once is everything cinema was invented for."
"Michelle Yeoh gives the best performance of her career in this visually stunning, uproariously entertaining, completely unique slice of sci-fi/fantasy from cinematic madmen Daniels."
"It’s time to accept this fact: this is Michelle Yeoh’s world, and we’re just living in it. This is the film of the year!"
"An all-encompassing, therapeutic Asian American film for us who build our identities around and seek to heal from cinema."
"It's a movie that's filled with the infinite possibilities of the multiverse, but ends up deciding that no, actually this universe is the one we've got – and that's all right with us."
"Visually dazzling, hilarious and surprisingly touching, it is a sublime masterpiece."
"If Charlie Kaufman had reinvented A Christmas Carol, it would look something like this. We can accept the film's absurdities because the storytelling is sharp, innovative and resolute and because the message squeezes through the noise of the absurd."
"Every scene of the movie is rife with infinite possibility, and even if a given scene may play in a way that makes familiar, narrative, structural sense, there's still a hint, that anything, anything at all, could be coming next."
There's a lot to enjoy .... And yet I found myself resisting the greeting-card conclusions.
"More or less a microcosm of your average day online—scrolling through feeds of random information, seeing context-less fragments of people’s lives, and generally feeling overwhelmed by the limitless drama unfolding at any given time, all over the world."
The Daniels accurately capture the organic changes in language and accent that divulge a character’s underlying traits.
The Daniels juggle silly gags and weird visuals like cackling Dadaists.
"The most movie to ever movie. An ambitious, bonkers and yet ultimately touching film that reminds you revel in your humanity; all told through the constantly inventive storytelling that never feels confusing despite the endless absurdity."
"Somewhere in the multiverse, ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is the biggest movie of the year, perhaps of all time, and it is beloved both critically and commercially, bringing about a new age of cinema that saves the theatrical exhibition industry..."
"Refreshingly vibrant and unique, a true force of film making."
"The best movie I've seen so far in 2022; I highly doubt I'll see anything better, more original or creative, intensely funny and exciting, Highly recommended! Full review in Spanish."
The Daniels have achieved a rare feat of imaginative tenderness in their way of representing ordinary people getting beaten down by the cruel pressures of the world -- and still finding ways to get back up again.
"I laughed. I wept. I cheered and I sobbed. As accurate as the film's title might be, it even more accurately describes the breadth of my feelings after experiencing it."
"Every version of me within the vast multiverse of existence loves this film. Exciting, hilarious and heartfelt, it's an achievement of the highest order. The universe needs this films. Full review in Spanish"
"Never have I seen a film with such scope and ambition succeed so imarveliously. ... The above rave notwithstanding, no film is perfector so Ive been told. ... Having authored the film to end all films, what the hell will Daniels follow it with?"
"Yeoh and Curtis are sensational, as is the supporting cast, including Hsu, Quan, Hong, and even Jenny Slate (as a disgruntled customer). One can only imagine how the Daniels will ever be able to top this film."
"Real life adulting is the ultimate foe to be vanquished in this deliriously haywire fantasy, a cinematic tab of acid buried in a metaphysical fable."
"Its a rich, wonderful, audacious project that will energize audiences like a cool breeze on a hot summer day"
"The heart of the story is the American dream scenario being questioned, only to find that family and sacrifice are worth the fight."
A towering achievement led by Michelle Yeoh's performance. Multiple universes collide in this hilarious and extremely touching story about embracing the ups and downs and the inherent chaos of life. Full Review in Spanish
I laughed throughout at the madness. If you are up for something weird give it a shot.
"""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" is a masterfully edited and downright wacky viewing experience."
"The Daniels also manage to create believable people to put in these outrageous circumstances, so the film gets by on more than simply shock value."
"There’s lots to recommend about Everything Everywhere All at Once, but the film’s frenetic busy-ness wore me down."
"Sometimes you get it and sometimes you don't, and I just didn't get this movie. Love Michelle Yeoh but she led me down the rabbit hole with this one."
"Best to know as little as possible, don't try to understand too much, just be ready for a wild ride. Just like real life."
"Everything Everywhere All at Once may find itself flirting with the potential for a happy ending, but it aspires and succeeds in ensuring the journey is paved in authentic and universal suffering."
The Daniels construct a vision of equally bold and affectionate ideals.
Its a wholly original movie at a time when originality is in short supply.
Just surrender yourself to this bonkers but brilliant film thats a demented fusion of Yeohs high-kicking origins and the multiversal madness currently unfolding in the Marvel movies.
"For a lot people in the Year of Our Ongoing Pandemic 2022, the expression ""living your worst you"" is really going to resonate."
I want to remember the feeling this movie gave me as I left the theater. It inspires me to be kinder and better in all of my relationships.
"Everything Everywhere All At Once is as absurd as it is profound, deeply moving and wholly original. The films final act is contemplative and heart-bursting with substance, and will monopolize your mind long after it ends."
"Brace yourself for a cinematic sugar rush so intent on swooping you into its alt-headspace so viscerally and with such speed the makers didnt even have time to put commas in the title. A singularly zany, off-the-wall, over-the-top, crazy sci-fi comedy."
"So moving, so funny, so emotional, so inventive, so crazy, so all-encompassing in its strangeness and heart that verbal descriptions are insufficient."
"An astonishing achievement that tells the simplest of stories in the most elaborate of ways. Outlandishly absurd yet deceptively powerful, it's truly unlike anything you've ever seen"
"... builds its mythology upon itself in the best possible and most entertaining ways... a multiversal sci-fi and fantasy kaleidoscope of a film grounded in a bitter reality daring to ask what version of oneself is considered ""best."""
"Packed with wall-to-wall creativity. I feel bad for anyone who has to get up to use the restroom during this picture, because if you miss even a single minute of it, you miss a lot."
“Everything” is an absolute joy -- a film I look forward to revisiting multiple times.
"If you're familiar with A24, you're probably going to like this movie. It certainly is something interesting to watch."
"Not the indie superhero movie some have been promising, but still a very moving film & serious awards contender. Yeoh gives a career best performance while Quan aka Indiana Jones' Short Round makes a triumphant return to acting. Sloppy but strong."
The film’s unadulterated silliness has an oddball appeal if you can adjust to the rate of its convolutions.
"""The most unusual film youll likely see this year. Its absurd, laugh-out-loud funny, and sneakily touching, an everything bagel of emotion that more than lives up to its title."""
"Everything Everywhere is a truly whacky epic... And yet it’s also, somehow, a story about the illusion of agency and reality itself."
"If you're looking for a very unique moviegoing experience, you'd be hard-pressed to find one this unique and enjoyable."
"I respect the integrity of it, and [it's] an imaginative story, and something original and fresh, but I was struggling to keep up."
"This film is as touching as it is absurd, and I wish it upon everyone."
"Approach this wondrous concoction with an open mind, and an expectation of giddy insanity and I promise you won't be disappointed."
"Its an oftentimes absurd movie, but one with plenty of heart as well."
"For all its abstraction and shenanigans, The Daniels made a movie that is purposefully accessible. Thats kind of the point. We are all in this nightmarish nonsense together."
The movies bright shining light is its cast.
Pure movie magic.
"Everything Everywhere All At Once will leave you breathless, confused, entertained, amazed, touched and maybe even a bit enlightened. But one thing is clear: Michelle Yeoh is a force to be reckoned with."
"Whichever way you dice it, there's nothing else quite like it in mainstream American cinema at the multiplex."
"In a world full of remakes, reboots and sequels a truly original film has become like the sasquatch of cinema, a mythical creature long thought to be lost forever. Finding Everything Everywhere All at Once feels just like that - mythical and just magical."
"[A] ridiculously entertaining, huge-hearted action-fantasy-comedy, a joyous ode to the multifaced wonder of life itself."
"Witty, wacky and unpredictable to the end."
"Everything Everywhere All At Once is an absolute blast and an unforgettably daft, moving and deceptively insightful ride."
"Everything Everywhere All at Once captures the majesty and originality of cinema while bestowing a multiverse of madness that offers an existential character study examining human desires, relationships, familial lineage, and life's choices."
"The sheer fact this isnt going to a streaming service is another miracle in of itself, furthering the films emotional hold on an audience who appreciate all facets of the medium that is genuine, passionate filmmaking."
Daniels have crafted a tour de force of pop surrealism on a budget that wouldnt cover Avengers: Endgames catering bill.
"In many ways a homage to the inimitable grace and talent of its star Michelle Yeoh, the film takes gleeful joy in the experiential potential of limitless cinematic shape-shifting."
The juggling act that Everything Everywhere All at Once pulls off between high concept outrageousness and real and recognisable moments of human failings  often within the one scene  is truly remarkable.
It’s a peculiar taste that might even split the opinions of diehard sci-fi/act/com fans.
"It’s gross and absurd, smart and silly, heart-breaking and heart-warming -- it’s everything in juxtaposition, seamlessly working together at the same time."
"It's a superlative tribute to the human spirit. A complex, eye-boggling, mind-blowing masterpiece."
"Disarms the audience with zany humor, then hits them with philosophy about the human condition."
"To my surprise, among oodles of unhinged sequences, I ended up enjoying this chaotic and far-fetched movie, which also happens to be conceptual and deliciously satiric."
"...this is the movie you've been waiting for, while asking, ""Why don't they make good, original, non-Marvel movies anymore?"" It's here, and now it's up to you to see what all the fuss is about."
"Fragmented and frenetic....It's like watching a deftly structured 'Sliding Doors' concept become an action--packed, cacophonous 'Cloud Atlas.'"
"There are movies that make you believe in movies. Everything Everywhere All at Once is absolutely one of them, an original vision in a Hollywood increasingly prone to repetition and redundancy."
"The Daniels have some crazy stuff running their imaginative minds, but knowing how to pair the insanity with heart is what sets them apart."
"In a movie about the infinite, the heart lies in the intimate. But inside these personal stories, you have comedy, horror, drama, sci-fi, mystery, martial arts. Every kind of movie really is inside this movie, all at once."
"Just when you cannot see yourself comprehending worlds with hot dog-length fingers or the silliness of sticky googly eyes, the brimming humanity underneath bubbles through with geysers of cathartic empathy."
"If it sounds like a fever dream, it plays like one, too, but at its heart, Everything Everywhere All At Once is a heartfelt story about forgiveness and family, featuring a bravura performance from Michelle Yeoh."
Everything Everywhere is a pleasant and intentionally ungainly production that corkscrews gleefully with ever-increasing power.
"The Daniels created something incredibly magical and mind-blowing, the actors delivered fully to every scene, and the entire cast really put together a brilliant work of art."
"Offers a devil-may-care approach and a deliciously wicked sense of humor, a top-flight performance from Michelle Yeoh, and an emotionally true central theme..."
"The kind of imaginative, uncompromising effort that can get people excited about movies. While the net effect can be an almost overwhelming exercise to absorb, ""Everything Everywhere"" deserves to be seen some time, and somewhere."
Evelyns road to discovery is a mind-tripping journey accentuated by hilarious situations and weird encounters with people she seems to know  yet actually doesnt.
"Everything Everywhere All at Once is an absolute marvel of visual storytelling, a mind-blowing cacophony of the absurd in the greatest possible sense, wrapped up in more heart than one movie should be allowed to contain."
"Despite its lofty ambitions, this is a work of emotional sincerity -- colossal sincerity."
"Visually and narratively inventive, yet grounded by powerful performances and surprisingly relatable conflicts."
"This subversive, genre-bending mayhem remains emotionally grounded beneath its high-minded silliness."
"Yeoh imbues Evelyn with moving shades of melancholy, regret, resolve and growing curiosity. She’s the kind of woman the world (and Hollywood) routinely overlooks, but Yeoh makes her embrace of lead-character energy positively gripping."
"Embraces chaos and defies categorization with frantic, eclectic, pure cinematic anarchy."
Just go see it. Buy the ticket. Take the ride.
"Everything Everywhere All at Once presents the idea that there is an infinite number of alternative universes out there, each with its own Michelle Yeoh. This is still not enough Michelle Yeoh."
"Were only a quarter of the way through 2022, but I am already fairly confident in saying that Everything Everywhere All at Once is the best film of the year. Not only that, its one of my favorite films of all time."
"Daniels combine their influences into a particular blend of batshit insanity the likes of which few would dare attempt, and even fewer would be able to pull off successfully. Bold, innovative films of this ilk have grown increasingly scarce."
"A crowd-pleasing, genre-bending adventure that's funny, dizzying, and infinitely memorable, this movie is also a lot."
"The two things you need to know about EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE are that: a) its not boring and b) its a wonderful showcase for Michelle Yeoh. Indeed, if its a must see for anyone its for fans of the actress."
"Amid all the puerile gags about tax receipts and hot dogs, the Daniels are urging us to connect with the people in this world, and the hijinks somehow make their message strangely moving. It is a unique achievement."
"Everything Everywhere is fringey and wayward, too often frenetic only for craziness’ sake. But Yeoh anchors it."
"Everything Everywhere All at Once will be absolutely adored by some moviegoers from its very first moments. It’s a film made to be loved—and, given the sheer eye-popping technical wizardry at play throughout, nearly impossible to hate."
"If youre excited to see a film that is theater-worthy but exhausted by the run-of-the-mill tentpole options out there, Everything Everywhere All at Once was tailor-made for you."
"A triumphant magnum-opus mind-bender of lo-fi sci-fi rooted in relatable ennui, as endlessly inventive for its high bar of engaging, enveloping drama as for its ever-lowered, always-cleared limbo bar of oddball multiversal storytelling."
"Everything Everywhere All at Once is a dizzying collage of sci-fi, action, comedy and drama that's also the most amazing thing I've seen in ages."
"At the heart of the insanity lurks a spot-on depiction of a midlife crisis, and Michelle Yeohs depiction of that crisis is revelatory."

"Daniels' return is all at once hilarious, thrilling and heartfelt, and everything we've come to expect from the phenomenal Michelle Yeoh."
"A bonkers and bizarrely wonderful genre mashup, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” is finally the multiverse movie that we can all relate to."
"A gob-smacking gauntlet of action-packed, gonzo sci-fi fantasy about the loopy connectedness of all things."
A beautiful exploration of life and what we have to offer as people and what people have to offer us in return. I can't recommend this movie enough!
"""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" delivers what will surely become a multi-generational movie thatll never stop offering surprises or nuances with each viewing."
"Everything Everywhere All At Once is a spectacular vision of the infinite, and a very heartfelt examination of a family coming to grips with itself."
Daniels have made a movie designed to blast audiences in the face with creativity.
"Daniels feature is a work that seems alive with possibility, a sensation so rare in modern genre filmmaking that its practically nausea-inducing to have it pumped into your brainstem at 24 fps."
Yeoh is magnificent.
"It's often great, never less than fun, and who can say no to a never-better Michelle Yeoh? The mix of all kinds of styles, genres, and techniques makes for one zany and colorful comedy."
"This multi-layered, thrill packed action, sci-fi  comedy, would be a fantastic experience if the script wasnt such a hot mess."
The best film of 2022 so far has such imagination and energy even though it can be dizzying and confusing. Thankfully it has a strong motherdaughter central relationship that becomes quite moving and profound. Astonishing in nearly every way.
"A thought-provoking genre-bending film that will stay with you long after. I will never see sausages, ratatouille, and Jaime Lee Curtis the same ever again."
"Under all this insanity, the film focuses on the characters. It's still a story about family."
"Bonkers and over-the-top films don't usually come with heartwarming messages, but this does just that. This is the cinematic experience audiences have been craving."
"In this anything-goes environment, the shifts don’t feel like tonal contradictions. They just feel like an acknowledgment that life is simultaneously painful and absurd, and that the tension between the two helps define the sensation of being human."
The endgame isn’t quite up to the movie’s game. But the game is onto something.
"This is a film that clearly needs to be seen multiple times to truly appreciate it, but it's not tough to love and admire after just one viewing."
"This sci-fi mashup has a message: Life might be fleeting, unremarkable, and inconsequential, but we should cherish it anyway."
"Whens the last time you went to the movies, and ended up contemplating your very existence? The movie delivers this existentialism, and the clownish absurdity of the family's fate ... it is adventurous, bizarre and just plain fun. Hail to THE DANIELS."
Entirely too much of a movie about how the world can feel like entirely too much. Especially these days. I loved it.
"A stunning achievement in the management of insane imagery, clashing tones, and wild plot escalations that defy description, but which drive home an extremely effective and emotional story."
"This film blends countless genres, storytelling techniques, and styles of humor together to create a unique experience. The level of detail is just ridiculous, and the journey is unlike any other."
"Everything Everywhere All At Once feels like a reimaging of The Matrix as directed by Michel Gondry. That pretty much encapsulates everything that’s right, wrong and way too long in this wildly ambitious movie."
"Everything is spectacularly creative, Everywhere you look, happening All at Once, begging to be revisited again and again."
"Inventiveness and sheer buoyancy, which “Everything” has in abundance, will take a movie a long way."
"Everything Everywhere All At Once is weird in the best of ways, emotional, smart, and ready to take viewers on a ride they wont soon forget."
"By shrewdly grounding the insanity in their characters, no matter how bizarre they may seem, the Daniels find actual emotional resonance that usually eludes this increasingly popular multiverse premise."
Michelle Yeoh gives the performance of a lifetime. This whole movie feels like a tribute to her and a celebration of her career.
"Everything Everywhere All At Once has all the spastic energy, phallocentric humour and visual wit directors the Daniels brought to the Turn Down For What video."
"Everything Everywhere All at Once doesnt make the argument that love will solve everything. Its too smart for that. Love is complicated, messy, entangled with our traditions, environments, and lived experiences."
"When I say Everything Everywhere All At Once is a surrealist journey into an existential crisis and the various shades of motherhood, what I mean is . . . exactly that...I kinda loved it."
"A dazzlingly kaleidoscopic adventure that is genuinely thrilling and often hilarious, with sensational martial arts fights in an always-astounding array of settings, with a roller coaster of surprising twists and turns that hold up on repeated viewings."
"A MOVIE movie with a genuine beginning, middle and end in the Age of Content, its something to see, I tell you what."
"It sets out to break your brain, finds an assortment of ways to break your heart ... and somehow pieces both together again with such skill of craft and narrative that it almost feels like a bit of a miracle."
You can say a lot of things about Everything Everywhere All At Once but you cant say youve ever seen anything quite like it before.
"There's filmmaking joy, impishness, and deep concern for relationship challenges included here, but moviemaking discipline isn't really a Daniels things."
"Everywhere Everything All At Once is everything; heartbreaking, heartwarming, absolutely insane, completely logical, and despite it being early in the year, without a doubt it's going to be one of the best movies of 2022."
"Multiverses may be all the rage right now, but the new sci-fi film from Daniels reckons with the consequences in a way that most blockbusters don’t."
"The Daniels’ Everything Everywhere All at Once is a deliriously over-the-top, multiverse-hopping action movie that unrepentantly pushes itself to the limit."
"This movie suffers from Terry Gilliam-itus, in that it suffers from too many ideas."
