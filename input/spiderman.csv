review
Director Jon Watts has spun a near-perfect cinematic web with this third effort in the Spider-Man franchise.
A once-in-a-lifetime movie event that still manages to cap off Tom Holland's Spider-Man trilogy in an exciting way.
"Spider-Man: No Way Home is not just the most epic and surprising of Jon Watts’ Spider-Man movies, but it’s also one of the most complex and enjoyable superhero films we’ve seen this decade."
"A celebration of Spider-Man that I wanted… I cried, I laughed, & GOD I wanted to jump/scream to the high heavens. Nothing can prepare you for the BRUTAL action sequences that are at the top of Spider-Man films. But the ending? PERFECTION I LOVED IT"
"A heartfelt, nostalgic homage to the Spider-Man legacy that fans will rewatch countless times, laughing and crying along for many more years to come. A memorable, passionate, once-in-a-lifetime cinematic experience."
"Spider-Man: No Way Home is about chosen families, and it’s about crystalizing the fact that though it’s dark today, these people are the reason why no one in the universe will ever be lacking love."
"Spider-Man: No Way Home completely moved me by the amount of heart that was put into the final installment of the trilogy by its entire cast, and the desire to please fans who cared not only about the MCU, but the character Spider-Man, in particular."
Spider-Man: No Way Home is truly an open love letter to the Spider-Man franchise crafted with such thoughtful care.
"It does have some shoehorned elements in for the sake of fan service, but overall I think that its positives far outweigh any faults it may have."
"Unfortunately, Marvel and director Jon Watts, with the third official entry from Spider-Man in the MCU, fail to learn a key lesson from the issues of previous Spider-Man franchises — sometimes less is more."
"It hits hard, gets emotional, it's darker than the others, for good reason. It makes you think deeply about the meaning of Spider-Man. It doesn't need to be light & fun..."
"The most ambitious, action-packed and emotionally satisfying live action Spider-Man movie ever made."
Much of the charm from the prior MCU web-slinging efforts remains intact.
"By the end, the direction of both the story and the MCU was murkier than before. But at some point all you can do is let the brains at the MCU hive-mind figure it out and then hope they’re able to bring it all together. It’s the best approach."
The spontaneous cheers in the cinema for Spider-Man: No Way Home were well worth it.
"""The one of the main things that I did like about this film is that some of the questions and the issues people had with the previous iterations were address and/or fixed in this film."" - Naturally Na"
Spider-Man: No Way Home is almost a psycho-study of the two-decade-long Spider-Man phenomenon.
"Better for big fans, but still fun for casual watchers."
This spider-sequel is always happiest when it's trying to catch the audience's claps and cheers just like flies.
"With half-baked conversations and inconclusive ideas, [the film] gets distracted halfway through a sequence as if it's trying to prevent its own progression because, in fact, it's actually searching for its offshoot. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Even though this compendium may require a master's in order to grasp its structure, No Way Home is still stupendously entertaining, has a clear voice, and the characters and action sequences are exciting. [Full review in Spanish]"
"While banking a tad hard on viewer's nostalgia, the movie still ultimately manages to provide a strong emotional throughline and sense of finality for not only Tom Holland's Spider-Man, but for its myriad cross-franchise characters."
Another fine and heartfelt performance by Tom Holland and some really fun appearances from past Spider-Man film characters cover for a script that was clearly rushed and lacking in any solid direction.
"Not only do you get the usual cool special effects that are typical of the genre but a fun trio of Spider-Mans, lots of humour and even emotions."
You think you already have a PhD in all things Peter Parker and Spider-Man? A few shock twists and some sobering turns in No Way Home will have you questioning your credentials in the best possible way.
"No Way Home is a busy, overly complicated, artificial movie, but it is also a superb new instalment of the Spider-Man saga."
"""He fell into a vat of electric eels.""
""Gotta be careful where you fall."""
"With the end of the latest adventure, ""No Way Home,"" Holland's time as Spider-Man may be at its end, but its one which is deeply satisfying, a conclusion marking the end of the beginning and this Spider-Mans first steps into proper herodom."
"SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME actually manages to cleverly incorporate the old without neglecting its own themes and emotional impact. Its certainly a bit messy, but it also gets a lot of things right."
"For Maguire and Garfield’s characters, the multiverse allows them a chance to make things right in the MCU."
A silly plot with very little character growth for Peter Parker that douses the film in fan service in hopes that we don't notice.
"A brand new Spidey movie with bigger stakes, bigger spectacle..."
"To my surprise, it's an entertaining sequel that hooks me, without reaching paroxysm, when it delivers the nostalgia-scented pyrotechnics of the friendly neighborhood spider that faces maturity. Full review in Spanish"
a polished piece of fan service accurately reflects the way pop-culture is eating itself right now
"Purely as a superhero film, this film has no comparison."
"The last half hour in particular feels like a collective group hug, leading to a bittersweet moment of rare delicacy for this franchise. It won over this frequent MCU dissenter."
It was a fun rollercoaster that really honoured the fans. People who've been part of this ride for a long time will get a lot out of this movie. (Steve)
"The heart and drama that made Homecoming and Far From Home so good is replaced by a script hitting carefully crafted ""a-ha"" moments that feel more ""Martha"" than ""I love you 3,000."" And that's fine. This film is fine. But I worry about what's next."
"No Way Home creates a strong repertoire between characters leading to organic moments of comedy. This film is an important stage in Tom Holland's Spider-Man, allowing us to see glimpses to a Peter that we want to see"
Easily the best super hero film of 2021!
"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is possibly the best film of the superhero boom  so why not do basically the exact same movie, except with real actors instead of computer animation?"
"Even though No Way Home is set in Disneys MCU, this movie manages to feel more like a love letter to fans of Sonys Spider-Man legacy. Most importantly, it resolves the previous installments cliffhanger."
Spider-Man: No Way Home has cemented itself as one of my favorite movies ever.
Spider-Man: No Way Home enters the pantheon of Marvel greats. Its a film that surpasses all expectations in ways you never knew you wanted but are ecstatic you got.
"In many ways, this is the most ""Spider-Man"" of any previous MCU outing, and Holland's Peter truly becomes his own hero."
Spider-Man: No Way Home is a massive crowd-pleaser sure to excite fans for the rest of MCU's Phase 4.
"Tom Hollands third outing in the Spider-Man costume is the one weve all been waiting for  an action-packed, well-thought out adventure that is what every comic book movie should be: fun."
It is ironically though cartoon movies that some of the most vast and heretofore obscured secrets of the cosmos are being revealed. Spider-verses and Multiverses indeed.
"A gripping, tense, fun, heartfelt, surprisingly touching, and very nostalgic love letter to Lee and Ditkos Amazing Spider-Man."
"A fun and entertaining entry to the MCU. Fan service to the max, but brilliantly executed."
"Designed above all else to make an audience cheer with excitement. But is there much more than that? If there's one film that aligns with the controversial auteur assessment that superhero films are more amusement park ride than cinema, it's this."
"""Spider-Man: No Way From Home"" is the best example of what superhero movies can be."
Enough surprises and twists to keep you entertained royally.
"For all its entertaining merits, Spider-Man: No Way Home felt to me more like a low-stakes trifle than a thrilling epic."
Delivers what most audiences crave: a good time at the movies.
Tom Holland gives one of the best performances of his life.
"Somewhere along the production line, it was decided to go big or go home, or not go home considering the title. Everything has to be louder, crazier, and over-the-top."
"Despite its epic length, the film breezes along..."
"What makes this Spider-Man so satisfying comes in large measure from the lucidity of the narrative, the quality of the villains, and an enjoyable balance of action, humor and emotion."
...a reminder that screenplays are as crucial to superhero movies as casting and special effects.
i personally feel like this Spider-Man is the best Spider-Man film that's ever been made.
Crossover comfort food with a redemptive twist.
"[A] robotic recombination of ""do you remember that?"" elements assembled with an almost complete lack of proficiency or grace."
A bloated 148 minute adventure that just fills in the gaps left by its trailers with less hook than one would expect.
"Even though it has a bit of a pacing issue before its universes-altering climactic stretch, it is another largely entertaining ride - one with an ending that should resonate with viewers and have lasting implications."
"Whilst not perfect and carrying a fairly thin narrative, No Way Home eventually surges to life and gives fans of the MCU, Spider-Man and blockbusters one hell of a ride."
Epic and action-packed.
Manages to turn it around in one piece thanks to a wonderful team of actors. [Full review in Spanish]
"'No Way Home' has a good amount of ""do you remember when"" ranging through the entire Spider-Man movie pantheon. But is a good end to Peter's MCU arc."
"Action-packed, nostalgic hit, jump-starting theater-going despite the Omicron variant."
"While clunky storytelling and middling direction prevent Spider-Man: No Way Home from becoming the MCU's first great Spider-Man movie, this is for the most part an inspired take on the oft-cynical fan service-rife sequels flooding Hollywood these days."
"There are mixed results, with some fascinating ideas mixed in with fan service up the wazoo, although other choices don't work at all"
The film is definitely a treat for Spidey fans as it is full of surprises and gives us an opportunity to see old faces we never thought we would see on the franchise again.
I think Holland is incredibly talented...
"Touching, exciting, and amusing, the MCU's 27th offering easily ranks among the franchise's most satisfying episodes."
"It's the must-see film of the winter season without question. It will break you, put you back together and break you again."
"One of the most awaited films in recent memory just hit the big screen, and for once, it delivered on every promise that fans dug up one rumor or leak after another."
"Director Jon Watts gives the ultimate celebration of what makes Peter Parker Spider-Man, and vice versa."
"Throughout all of it, the weird and complex history of Spider-Man as a cinematic icon isn't a hindrance to the story; instead, it's an enhancement, using the quirks of the character's legacy as a source of illumination into why he has endured so long."
"Given the sheer scope of the narrative, you can virtually hear the film creaking under the weight of its own ambition more than once, but for the most part, it delivers on a gargantuan scale."
"To its credit, No Way Home weaves together stories, characters, moments and icons of more than two decades, to deliver applause and cheers that reverberate just as loud in half-empty, post-pandemic cinema halls."
"Shaky plot aside, No Way Home relies on the customary steady stream of explosions, pre-visualized fight scenes, and eager-to-please humour to keep things going, ensuring there's never a dull moment, but rarely a great one."
The movie allows for a surprisingly impactful reappraisal of a long-held Spidey franchise consensus.
"This film is fan service at its best because even us, casual lovers, can enjoy the ride."
"While No Way Home is but a cog in a larger movie-making machine, it stands on its own as a wonderful third entry in a series that is primed to usher the younger generation of audiences into the future of the ever-expanding MCU."
"Full credit to the film that, despite it feeling unwieldy at times, it manages to ensure too many villains don't end up spoiling the broth."
"No Way Home is a testament to how enjoyable the ""legacy sequel"" can be when it respects what came before without letting it upstage the new(er) characters."
Holland has always been a great Spider-Man but he ascends to a new level here.
"I love Holland in the suit, and I've liked the first two films quite a bit. But this? THIS??? Nothing quite prepared me for this."
"When the dust settles, the result is a hero closer to what creators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko originally envisioned. Friendly. Neighbourhood. Spider-Man."
Spider-Man: No Way Home is the test of what it means to be a hero and what it costs...This movie has a heartbeat.
"Devoted fans will relish in the quick-witted script, revisiting the past and looking to the future as this popcorn-munching movie is an excellent ride till the end."
"Nostalgia and redemption make up Spider-Man: No Way Home, the latest release from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and possibly the best movie from the franchise yet."
It's a pretty well-woven mashup that never stops spinning; it's only spider-bite deep and good senseless fun.
Cracking open the multi-verse in the MCU and keeping the fans happy. Almost a remake of the 'Into The Spider-verse' animated movie with virtually the same gimmick.
"Dafoe and Molina are the scene stealers in the movie, with a special mention to Dafoe for bringing back the terror he gave me at the age of 6."
"With Tom Holland, Zendaya and a cast of (many) other characters, our semi-spoilery take on Peter Parker's latest adventure shows what happens when the past literally collides with the present."
"Much more interested in maintaining a strong connection (and the consequent marketing potential) between all its movies/products, Marvel cant afford to allow any trace of authorship or imagination in its individual projects. [Full review in Portuguese]"
It concludes the trilogy that began with Homecoming so perfectly that whatever comes next is going to feel like something entirely new.
"More Spider-Man, please! Always more Spider-Man."
...the most satisfying Spidey adventure since the Sam Raimi era.
"Fantastic, thrilling, and surprisingly emotional."
"I won't say I was bored, but it's wall-to-wall fan service. It's almost like a sitcom."
"This movie's a total blast, but it's also surprisingly emotional at times, too."
"This sort of well meaning, but poorly executed approach leads what could be interesting, to feel like nothing but fan service that doesn't do anything worthwhile for the previous stories or this one."
The second half is so good and satisfying that you forget that the first half is pretty mediocre.
"Most of all, it's just enthusiastic, contagious fun."
"Liberated from his mask and fully free to emote, Tom Holland is excellent as the pocket-sized hero..."
"Although it's easy to follow the film independently, knowledge of the previous Spider-Man films only enriches this sweeping experience."
"I felt some actual emotion, even with all this chaos swirling around. And in the end Spider-Man: No Way Home somehow finds a way to keep it all together."
Great storytelling with an emotional payoff...and Holland's boyish charm seals the deal.
"This movie is a commemoration of everything about Peter Parker that people have loved for so long, and for all its flaws, it still delivers on what's most important."
"Benedict Cumberbatch and Willem Dafoe frequently threaten to run away with the film. To Tom Holland's credit, he holds his ground. The competition is no less fierce from Zendaya."
"This is a film that is impossible not to like. Fans will shed tears, but those emotions are more due to our collective investment in the character, who has dominated the box office over the last 19 years."
No Way Home is a great example of 'fan service' done right. An exciting crowd pleaser with redemptive qualities & genuine emotional resonance that can break through even the most bombastic action sequences.
"No Way Home just wants what the other films in the series had without the understanding or meaning, fully cognizant of its position as a cog in a larger machine that has no time or patience for any of that."
The ending touches me every single time.
"What holds the attention is the strongly character-based writing, which allows a smart, gifted cast to bring texture and nuance even when things get chaotic."
"This film is overloaded with characters, conflicts, role-reversals and complications. It is impressive filmmaking to make such an unwieldy plot work as well as it does. It helps to have good actors and a top flight team of visual effects people."
"A witty, energetic and surprisingly moving display that soars higher than most of its predecessors."
A fantastic experience with an audience.
"The fact that the movie works as well as it does is all the more impressive considering just how many cameos, easter eggs, and general fan servicey stuff it has to serve up in the midst of having, you know, a plot."
"When an entire movie is built on a rickety foundation of scenes designed to deliver shock and awe, there's a chance that it can all come tumbling down."
"So often in these big multi-villain events, the hero gets swallowed up, but here he defines the film."
"Without a doubt, No Way Home is [Marvel's] most ambitious outing to date."
"It weaves action, comedy and romance."
"Who knows where the character would go next, but as far as Spidey films go, this seems unbeatable."
"Ultimately, it's pulled together in a way that will make you fall in love with Spider-Man all over again."
Full of heart and everything we love in superhero movies.
As fun as it is strained in equal parts. [Full review in Spanish]
An entertaining story that manages to meet the public's expectations. [Full review in Spanish]
One of the most emotional adventures ever produced by the Marvel Cinematic Universe. [Full review in Spanish]
No Way Home ultimately winds up setting Spidey atop the pantheon as the MCU's greatest and most complete trilogy.
"Despite a lot of bloat, the film is a joyous cinematic celebration of a certain wall-crawler."
No Way Home is a deeply profound and profoundly hilarious experience from start to finish - one that words will never quite do justice.
A film destined to be enthusiastically embraced by both old-school web slinger junkies and fans of the multi-film corporate franchise in which he is currently ensnared.
"I'm happy to say that ""No Way Home"" meets and surpasses the hopes I had for it as it pulls off the impressive feat of serving as a denouement for three Spidey franchises while serving as a reboot for all web-crawling adventures to come."
"Despite Marvel's usual bloat and a swirling storm of characters, ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" earns its joy and sorrow with thematic substance, the breathless action often contrasted with quiet reflection and grief."
It's astonishing how good Marvel is at playing with their toys. Fan service can be fun when it isn't at the expense of serving characters or story. It can be sheer euphoria when it manages to ENHANCE character and story. This movie is sheer euphoria.
"An overstuffed homage to Sony and Marvel's two decades in the Spider-fam business, the film nevertheless manages to be utterly charming, a feel-good two-and-a-half hour last hurrah for fans."
"Out of all the recent ""Spider-Man"" movies, this one comes closest to the skillful combination of visuals and heart that made Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man 2"" one of the best superhero films ever."
Worth of the chatter... A lot of what you've heard online is true.
"It's anything but artful, but there's no denying the power of its crossover charms..."
"It can sometimes get a little too wrapped up in the story but, overall, Spider-Man: No Way Home is an absolute blast. It'll make you laugh, cry, and smile from ear to ear."
"It's a form of breaking the fourth wall, inviting the audience in to share a joke with the actors, and verges on parody. Yet somehow they carry it off without diluting our sense of involvement with Peter and those he loves."
"A riveting finale helped seal the deal for an imperfect film. While there's a little too much fan service at times, Holland and the cast make it all seem exhilarating."
"No Way Home delivers everything you want from a Marvel epic and then some. It's cheekily self-aware, unapologetically heartfelt, and thrilling from start to finish."
This might be my #1 Marvel movie. It was as close to perfect in a movie on this scale as I have ever seen. It somehow met high expectations and exceeded them.
"This might be my favorite Spiderman movie. The performances were great, it provides closure to some story arcs that I wasn't expecting and had a bunch of surprises. This is why I go to the movies!"
"Clever, ambitious and hugely spectacular."
"Watts' deft handle on the Spider-Man universe results in a film in which novelty, substance, and high-grace pop-culture entertainment blend very well together."
"We're among old friends, and they are all on fine form."
"Warmth, wisdom, humor, charm, camaraderie, poignancy and throwback wrapped in iconic images and interactions. Nostalgic and iconic, a special tribute to fans... You'll never see another superhero movie like this one, truly one-of-a-kind."
"Is it blatant, downright good entertainment that nudges at our nostalgic hearts and reminds us how good these villains still are and how dearly we hold this franchise? You bet your spidey senses."
"It's all part of a knowing scheme that repurposes what came before to create an Endgame sense of anticipation and payoff. It's wholly unearned, but you have to give producer Kevin Feige credit - recycling has never been this profitable."
"I walked in worried thinking Sony would ruin Spider-Man with a forced wannabe Sinister Six movie, but walked out humbled and satisfied. Not perfect by far, but great and a ton of fun!"
"However ungainly the first part of Spider-Man: No Way Home is, the gut-punch ending brings the entire trilogy full circle."
"Fails as both a film and a piece of storytelling because in its desperation to give its villains a ""second chance,"" it reveals that it has nothing new or interesting to add to their stories."
"Despite its flaws (too much hokum), I guess friends of the franchise will still dig this spirited version."
"This is a very full film with a lot to take in, but the pace's ebb and flow allows viewers just enough time to digest before the next big development."
A glimpse in to what makes Spider-Man such a timeless hero...
Spider-Man: No Way Home is a nostalgic extravaganza that exceeds expectations and is a perfect and satisfying bookend for the first three Tom Holland Spider-Man movies.
"This 'Spider-Man' sequel has all the necessary ingredients for a top-notch superhero movie, including hilarity and heart, action and anxiousness, and some happy surprises."
"An overflowing, funnel-web cornucopia of treats for Spider-fans."
"It is absolutely EVERYTHING we fans expected; a moving film full of action, fanservice, and extremely satisfying moments. [Full review in Spanish]"
"For me, No Way Home is joyful. Others will find it infuriating and strangely reductive. And either way, it could be a sign of times to come."
There are things in here that almost feel like they're too good to be in a movie like this - especially when they get to the dramatic stuff.
"No Way Home isn't just about looking back at old films. It also opens up new avenues for the Marvel Universe - or the Marvel Multiverse, to be more accurate."
"In going backward to acknowledge several generations of movies, Spider-Man takes a welcome step forward. Perhaps that's what matters most when it comes to a franchise."
It feels like the first time that this Peter Parker gets to grow up.
"Jon Watts' closing Homecoming chapter is a heavily emotional affair, to say the least."
"It's everything you want from a movie like this... Overall, it's a fun movie."
"There's nothing earth-shattering going on here, but it is highly enjoyable entertainment and a loving, mostly well-executed piece of character speculation. As part of a larger universe, it makes little impact. But as a one-off, it's pretty darn fun."
"It's all dumb gimmicks, sci-fi gobbledygook, and digital spectacle, and the central love story is such an afterthought that the young couple (Tom Holland and Zendaya) barely spend any time together."
"A visual spectacle that doesn't stint on the excesses of CGI, while never forgetting that the way to engage an audience is to make it care about the protagonists."
The film is a hellacious amount of fun. It is unashamed fan service and probably a smart Marvel re-set after the muted and unfamiliar Eternals and Shang-Chi.
"That's a lot of balls to juggle. And the fact that No Way Home succeeds in pulling off as many of them as it does is impressive, especially when it comes to the fan service - but much like Peter Parker, this movie can't have everything."
"Much like Avengers: Endgame, this movie makes even its most unloved predecessors seem worthier in retrospect. That's not a bad trick."
"The sloppy is so sloppy, the slow so slow, the action so house. What works about Spider-Man: No Way Home (hereafter No Way Home) is its essential understanding of Spider-Man as basically just a good kid."
"No Way Home not only meets those grand standards it boldly aims for, it swings over them in style and delivers maybe the greatest entry in the MCU."
A fascinatingly messy film that tries to juggle fan service with a finale for Peter's high school years.
A Fun Escape
It reaches a point at which the division between sincerity and cynicism doesn't seem to matter much anymore - it will work for the right people. And that is an art in itself.
"It's hard to live up to the expectations of a film like Spider-Man: No Way Home. And yet, somehow Jon Watts' charming, emotional, and funny third Spidey movie does just that."
"Spider-Man is the patron saint of the futile effort, the mascot of trying to save everyone, even if they hate you. No Way Home is a treatise on not giving up on people, even when it hurts. Poo-poo Peter's parable all you want, but it's what I needed."
It's impossible to say what more fans and critics could have asked for that No Way Home doesn't deliver.
"Spider-Man: No Way Home is the biggest and boldest MCU entry in a year packed with them...huge but not unwieldy, fan service-y but not exclusive, epic but not crowded...A joyful and poignant example of the many things the MCU does well."
"It's delightful, and it's also thoroughly earned."
"Paying its due diligence to the many characters and films that paved the way for the current version of Spider-Man, No Way Home is the perfect blend of the unexpected and the familiar: creating a cinematic experience most fans won't soon forget."
"Spider-Man: No Way Home is, in a word, amazing, spectacular, sensational. You might even call it the ultimate Spider-Man film."
"While the previous Holland films have been mediocre in modest ways, No Way Home feels downright aggressive in its mediocrity..."
"If it occasionally treads where many superhero pictures have gone before, it does so in a way that feels fresh and invigorating."
"Yet again, Spider-Man's wants and needs are deferred for villains that were created by someone else. It is as if he's a medium that's shown up at the wrong séance, left to exorcise ghosts of someone else's past."
Holland attains maximum poignance and amiability and the franchise soars into fan heaven while making believers of us all.
"What most impressed me was what they are doing with the tech, not only for the superhero stunts, but in creating truly memorable production design. Another fun Marvel triumph."
Director Jon Watts delivers a spectacular action piece balanced with much emotional turmoil.
"While not quite hitting the highs of the similarly-themed animated offering Into the Spider-Verse, Jon Watts' Spider-Man: No Way Home is still a thoroughly entertaining, web-slinging adventure."
"'No Way Home' may or may not be the best Spider-Man movie, but it's the most rewarding one."
"To be sure, the film's not dull, and there are enough inventive moments to carry you through mostly unscathed, but it doesn't generate much forward-leaning energy, the sense of things to come, as much as it sort of stumbles to the finish line."
"It feels exuberant and ridiculous, but it's a superhero movie. A kid bitten by a spider, in a suit made by a genius, swings from synthetic webbing - but sure, let's nitpick ""reality."""
"It's fun to see that after 20-plus movies that Marvel is still working hard to surprise us and take its cinematic universe in exciting new directions. If ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" is any indication, literally anything is possible."
"Spider-Man is always best on the back foot, and this film puts him thoroughly through the wringer. But it also gives him room to shine, and packs an emotional punch that could floor any of his villains."
"The best parts of this bloated and uneven two-and-a-half-hour movie are the connections to past Spidey versions. Considering that just in the last 19 years we've had eight live-action Spider-Man features, there's a lot of material to draw from."
Director Jon Watts hasn't got enough credit for shepherding Spider-Man through the last three films.
A pretty entertaining piece of pop cinema that even those who have no particular interest in superhero films -- and I fall into that category -- can still embrace.
No Way Homeshows maturity alongside Parker's growth.
Forget what you've heard about what may or may not happen in No Way Home -- because the film surpasses every fan theory by a mile-and-a-half and the only way to enjoy it is to sit back and let yourselves be swung from height to dizzyingly new heights.
"For the kids who grew up with all the different incarnations of the superhero on the big screen and are now teenagers themselves, Spider-Man: No Way Home offers treats galore... that goes for the big kids too."
"No Way Home takes the audience on a ride, with the web-slinger swinging higher than ever, and caught in a web of villains that no superhero movie has seen before."
High-octane effects and nifty dialogue power a meta narrative that lifts the Spider-Man universe into more emotionally-charged territory.
"Easily this year's most satisfying blockbuster, featuring an epic story and moments that fans will keep close to their hearts for years to come."
Perfectly calibrated fan service. [Full review in Spanish]
"Creatively plays with the multiverse concept, but also utilizes it for a greater thematic purpose."
"In an age when nothing seems sacred, this film does a surprisingly good job of resurrecting the past without trampling too much of what made it special in the first place."
"""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" is an imaginative, freewheeling trilogy closer that not only stands among the MCU's superior entries, but arguably the best ""Spider-Man"" yet."
Spider-Man: No Way Home is easily the best Spider-Man film I've ever seen since Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 (2004)
"Delivers a wild, multi-universal ride that seemed unfathomable years ago and only something you could read in the comics and not watch on the big screen. Yet here we are now."
"This could only come about by carefully archiving, arranging, and remixing 20 years of superhero film history across multiple timelines, directors, and franchises."
"Tom Holland is better than ever in his surprise-packed, third solo outing as a teen hero in a onesie who's out to save the world and a faltering pandemic box office. But this time the generic thrills are tempered with genuine emotion. Good one, Spidey."
"Short on story, long on insider humor, this Spidey entry marks a sudden drop-off in quality."
"Whatever universe you are from, Spider-Man is a comic book adventure that seems to find endless ways to reinvent itself and keep us entertained."
"Feels like a long-awaited, mid-pandemic return home for Spidey movie fans."
"It's zippy, action-packed and its heart is in the right place."
"You don't need to have seen any of the previous Spider-Man movies to follow this one. But it's much more entertaining - more affecting, too - if you have."
The film maintains an excellent blend of the domestic and the dramatic.
"A bombastic, crowdpleaser which is sharp, funny and just as chaotic as its titular character. Like a bratpack movie, it's a film about growing up, knowing one's place in the world and appreciating it for what it is."
"If he can have more solo adventures as good as this one, I admit I'm finally curious to see where this version of the wall-crawler goes next."
Spider-Man: No Way Home is a showcase example of how Marvel keeps spinning together threads of what has come before. Even elements from long before the MCU was realized and it winds up letting us see old stories in a new light.
"But before the surprisingly rousing third act, 'No Way Home' is some seriously rough sledding. reflecting what a non-starter Tom Holland's MCU incarnation of Peter Parker has turned out to be."
Director Jon Watts has closed out his trilogy with a rip-roaring rollercoaster ride of an event. Spider-Man: No Way Home is the Endgame of Spider-Man movies.
"In its own metaphysical form, the movie pays homage to the legacy of Spider-Man as a hero; leaving long-time fans with a wholesome feeling of Christmas arriving a few weeks early, and new ones with a smile as wide as Times Square on a sunny day."
"Even if you haven't seen all the films in the franchise, director Watts slings a thrilling web for one of the best Marvel adventures where Tom Holland sticks the landing."
"How its nostalgic elements will age remains to be seen, but what is for sure, we're going to be looking at the impact of No Way Home for a very long time."
"Involving, eye-popping and filled with welcome surprises, ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" is a super superhero entry."
"No Way Home does something never before seen, celebrating everything Spider-Man has been on the silver screen to the delight of fans and creators alike, and that's all the audience needs to know."
"Hollywood's most awkward co-parenting exercise concludes (for now?) in an overstuffed but by no means unsatisfying feature that's one part payoff-machine for 20 years worth of Spider-Man history, one part way-too-meta franchise-management exercise"
"Given the infinite possibilities for chaos, it's remarkable that this sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far From Home makes any sense at all. Yet it does, emotionally more than narratively."
Go see Spider-Man: No Way Home... And don't get up from your seats when the final credits start. [Full review in Spanish.
"I girded myself for more of the same with ""No Way Home"" and was pleasantly surprised to NOT see more of the same."
"As superhero movies go, this one offers its share of satisfying moments and is guaranteed to warm the heart of any Spider-Man movie fan, regardless of when their fandom started."
"Like almost every Marvel production, this one is too long and, at two and a half hours, overstays its welcome. But before that, the movie nicely snaps and pops."
"There are some wonderful surprises in a film that felt to me like an elegant farewell to the Tom Holland era, as well as a fond requiem for 20 long years of Spider-Man productions."
"Top to bottom from a production standpoint and crowned with a smile from ear to ear, this is what big screen escapism and dream fulfillment looks like at the highest level."
"Marvel comics... has continued to keep the flame (the Statue of Liberty's torch, with or without Captain America's shield) lit. [Full review in Spanish]"
The one where Peter grows up. No Way Home delivers more than just fan service in the best way possible.
A triumph of popcorn cinema.
Spider-Man: No Way Home is a fun romp through the Spider-Man Universe! Just don't forget the tissues. Less kid-friendly than previous Spider-Man films.
"Between his savvy filmmaking and his lead's endless charm, Watts has easily crafted the best set of superhero films in the Marvel (or Sony) universe."
I loved this movie!
I had a lot of fun.
"No Way Home rests on the shoulders of Holland, who ... possesses the emotional depth and performative range to make for a captivating lead and a pretty damn good Spider-Man."
"It's an intriguing idea -- paving a new Spidey future by interrogating our collective Spidey past. Still, it's one that will probably play best for those already invested in the Spider-Verse, rather than those just swinging by."
"For audiences who dread the chokehold that superhero movies have on the multiplex, it's something like a worst nightmare: creative bankruptcy given a positive, meta-narrative PR spin. Fans are going to love it."
"While not necessarily the best film of the year, Spider-Man: No Way Home makes up for the technical deficiencies with several surprises along the way."
"It finds its true tone, funny and bittersweet. [Full review in Spanish]"
Here's the short version: it's fine.
"[There's] a satisfying feeling of closure that comes from catching up with characters who feel like old friends. It's a tragedy that this feels glib and undercooked, making this project feel more like a fan convention than a movie."
It's a hectic series of plot twists and deus ex machinas that overturns an entire bucket of action figures and smashes them all together with delight. The film might be a new nadir of cinema -- but it's also an undeniably watchable good time.
"For those who can accept fan-service driven plots, action sequences that look like cut scenes of a video game, and the inevitable set up for the next instalment, it's a fun, frothy superhero film, that has moments that shine amidst all the CG shenanigans."
"There have been many creative spills with this franchise, but this latest entry manages to mop it up. You'll laugh until it hurts, become a sobbing mess and feel your heart grow for so many reasons. It's everything you could want this trilogy closer to be"
"Easily the best and most ambitious of the new Spidey flicks, taking big ideas and marrying them to the standard thematics that come with everyone's favorite web-slinger."
Lives up to expectations. [Full review in Spanish]
Spider-Man: No Way Home feels like the worst kind of comic book storytelling: it only exists to heap fan-service upon the viewer and create a new foundation to build upon.
A greatest hits carousel powered by fan service and corporate recycling.
This is the four-course meal that will have you scarfing down everything that you're given and then returning for seconds.
Spider-Man: No Way Home kicks it old-school and plays the hero's hits with an eventful action-adventure that's giddy fun.
"I won't spoil the juicy surprises that await, but suffice it to say, the returning characters hauled in are very welcome, by and large, and multiply the fun of this fare exponentially."
"'Spider-Man: No Way Home,' while not playing for laughs, is very playful with a lot of humor, not only among the villains but between Peter and Strange."
"It's called ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" but a better title for this exhausting sequel would be ""Spider-Man: For Superfans Only."""
"[M]uch to their credit, screenwriters Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers decide to get weird."
"Spider-Man: No Way Home may not be as thrilling as some fans hope, but it more than makes up for any lack with a story that stays true to who Spider-Man/Peter Parker is. He can be a superhero while still maintaining the bonds he holds near and dear."
A reminder of what it is like to have fun at the movies. Absolutely thrilling!
Spider-man: No Way Home knows how to take advantage of a risky and daring starting point to build a film that pays tribute to its past.
"The MCU is a high-floor/low-ceiling enterprise, and No Way Home is slightly closer to the ceiling than the floor, exactly like all the other Spider-Man movies."
[Spider-Man: No Way Home is] overdetermined fan-service ... [but] it does mine some genuine poignancy out of the idea of tangling up three unfinished series' emotional arcs.
It is movies like Spider-Man: No Way Home that will keep the MCU strong for years and years to come.
"The action is handled decently, the special effects are good, and the film is entertaining from start to finish, even with some serious moments of grief, anger, and so on thrown in for good measure."
"...writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers apparently looked to the ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" animation for inspiration, their trilogy capper not only veering into the MCU, but encompassing all things Spider-Man since Sam Raimi's 2002 film."
"The Church of Gesù of Marvel movies, a canonical close read unrivalled in its density of detail and scriptural self-referentiality, as sticky and exhausting as a day at a theme park."
"Your eyeballs will dance and, depending on your level of fandom, maybe even well up from time to time."
Even more bloated than previous 'Spider-Man' sequels [but] rescued by the substantial doses of humor and heart that the filmmakers and cast bring to the picture.
"The film really starts to thread the core Spider-Man ethos, ""with great power comes great responsibility"" into Tom Holland's story even more than his previous appearances."
"It almost collapses under the weight of fan speculation and internet theories, but keeps its heart going via a bloodstream packed to the gills with white-hot fan service."
For superhero fans it will be hard to forget.
"It's pretty good fun, with some joyfully handled final act twists."
It's a relief to report that director Jon Watts and his writers move the character forward with the right amount of wit and abundant energy.
"""Spider-Man: No Way Home,"" for fanatic followers of the webslinger, is a big, fat Christmas present, covered in shiny, blue-and-red wrapping paper and all tied up with a pretty web bow."
"At the risk of getting cheesy, it won't just make you cheer, it'll make you want to hug your friends, too."
"After a mostly average year for the MCU across their blockbusters and Disney+ shows, Spider-Man: No Way Home is a return to form for the franchise."
"Casting Tom Holland as Peter Parker was one of the sharper decisions to emerge from the ever-present, oxygen-sucking Marvel Cinematic Universe. What a business model!"
"Holland gives one of, if not the best performance in the MCU films. ""No Way Home"" is wonderfully ridiculous and surprisingly emotional."
"When it comes to cinematic threequels, No Way Home stands proudly as one of the best...the ultimate crowd-pleaser while celebrating the beauty of the Marvel Cinematic Universe....sorry, Multiverse."
"Not only is it the best of the MCU trilogy, it's the biggest and most emotional of all the Spider-Man films to date. An awesome celebration of the character's legacy and the perfect way to end the year at the movies. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The MCU has had more gems than rocks over the years, with pretty much each hero (""Iron Man, Thor) hitting an occasional bump in the road. Not Spider-man. To me his series of films is head and shoulders the best of the stand-alone films."
"[For Peter] Parker, with great power might come great responsibility, but for Hollywood, with great power simply comes more greed."
"What works here is the ramped-up stakes, emotion, and game-changer aesthetic. And Dafoe's Goblin is the stuff of villain legend."
"In this most enjoyable of any 'Spidey' film of the Tom Holland (as Peter Parker) era, young pals, new friends and a few seriously super surprises help our hero deal with the big trouble instigated during the cliffhanger climax of 2019's 'Far From Home.'"
"It's too reliant on nostalgia to reach the heights of Spider-Man 2, Into the Spider-Verse or Far From Home, but as a celebration of the character, it's a sumptuous feast of superhero fun."
"The most essential MCU Spider-Man film and the best. Never loses track of the character, emotion, and heart at its center."
"The film ends with some seismic changes to the MCU, and to Peter himself; let's hope Feige et al. has enough courage to follow through with them."
