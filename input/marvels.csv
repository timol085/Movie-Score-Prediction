review
"Oh boy, I am so tired of the MCU... Now it's the same film over and over and over again."
"This is false sophistication, especially in this case, when it covers up the visual ineptitude and chaos of The Marvels."
"The whole ""Captain Marvel"" franchise is diluted and shredded in this average action thriller."
"[The Marvels] feels like the finale to a season of television we never got, and perhaps a series would have given each of these characters the time they needed to fully explore each of their individual issues."
"It’s all rather standard superhero sci-fi ... with the welcome variation that almost all of the key characters are women. Vellani is funny and sweet as Kamala, an unabashed Captain Marvel fangirl who doesn’t hide her excitement at joining the fray."
"If Marvel is trying to win back audience enthusiasm, centering its characters and a sense of fun is the right approach. And teaming up with talented directors like Nia DaCosta goes a long way on executing that approach"
"It's not a disaster—it's too entertaining and too well-acted to be that. I loved how imaginative it can be; action scenes are sufficiently exciting, and visual effects are better polished than those of other recent superhero films. Full review in Spanish."
It's disappointing this film will be written off as an MCU flop because its superior to plenty of other entries in the franchise that fared better at the box office.
"The story is actually very tragic, but Marvel doesn't allow it to be so as to not leave out any jokes. As a result, not everything has the space it needs to develop. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Directed by Nia DaCosta, “The Marvels” even gives short shrift to Goose, the orange cat who steals scenes with abandon."
"Gleefully silly, wonderfully charming, inventive, funny, and dramatic. It is also so reliant on its audience having seen multiple streaming serials that it’s honestly like a popcorn flick assigned its audience homework."
"The Marvels was seemingly designed to coast, bringing nothing that we haven’t seen before."
"Ably synthesizes the narrative strands of Captain Marvel, WandaVision, and Ms. Marvel with plentiful laughs and Marvel’s typical top-notch action — albeit with some initial choppiness."
...an impossibly incoherent endeavor that strikes all the wrong notes right from the get-go...
"While there are parts that are too thin and a few mystifying plot holes, the movie more than makes up for them with an irreverent and joyful story about found family that features truly wonderful chemistry between its three leading women."
"DaCosta’s film sings and is a breath of fresh air, rather than the MCU’s death rattle. Lifted by the chemistry of its leads - with a wonderful Vellani - it might not be top-tier, but it’s certainly enjoyable despite a handful of stumbles along the way."
"DeCosta brings a much-appreciated grounded approach to the story, while demonstrating a great sense of humor and ability to direct action. Meanwhile, Larson, Parris, and Vellani are simply dynamite together."
"There are problems with the plot, but I liked the interplay between the main characters. Zawe Ashton, playing Dar-Benn, is an especially effective villain. The movie does have a lot of humor in it and some good action scenes."
"While the titular Marvels make for an endearing, women-centric found family, the film’s hyperawareness of its role in a larger universe is its downfall."
"In this simple, entertaining sequel, Captain Marvel has grown past her wobbly origin story and into a bond with two other impressive women who make her temporary team"
"Despite a script that is chock full of good lines and a cast of willing participants, this is more meh than Marvel"
"The Marvels is still a joyous cinematic spectacle, and there are much worse ways to while away a rainy weekend afternoon with the kids. The Marvels is strong, simple, somewhat indistinct but satisfying all the same."
"Isn’t perfect, but it’s a damn good time, packed with some great universe developments, interesting twists, and a memorable performance from rising star Iman Vellani..."
"DaCosta keeps her cameras on the hop, barely pausing to allow the slower beats to hit, but the film's leads do serviceable work giving their characters heart, and with Vellani winning the bulk of the audience-winning funny dialogue."
"These are fundamental issues and, while the film has its moments, it’s never consistent enough to hit the spot. You want to enjoy it all the way through, but it never lets you."
"Call me old-fashioned, but even with fantasy superhero tropes I still want to care enough to follow the journey and invest in the outcomes. The Marvels lost me early and never won me back."
"Amid its putative decline, the franchise has unleashed some of its liveliest and strangest films, from the oedipal Shang-Chi to the operatic Eternals. The trend toward general wackiness continues with The Marvels."
"Though proceedings do improve once we reach a relatively coherent final act, the weak chemistry between the three leads never gets any better."
Iman Vellani is a star and is absolutely captivating.
"It’s silly and makes little sense, but it’s such a fun time at the movies. And isn’t that why we go to see movies in the first place?"
"If we cut through all the noise surrounding the film, and look at it for what it does and what it is, the easy conclusion is that it’s an entertaining, mid-tier MCU flick."
"Continuing the story of at least four other Marvel projects, the film is structurally messy but provides a Flerken fun time with a lot to get excited over."
"Weaving together strands from various Marvel movies and series, this feels designed specifically for fans. But anyone will enjoy the nutty vibe that drives the chaotic plot, which is so formulaic that it requires no thought at all."
"I had fun, I really enjoyed it. Also, I'm a huge fan of Kamala Khan. Iman Velani is amazing. I was just so pleased to get more of her."
"I enjoyed this movie for what it was. It's a mess, there's a lot of problems in it, I'm not going to lie, but it's still a fun time,"
This is the kind of bad movie even the most cowardly critics can feel safe piling on.
"Plot wise, thanks to the proliferation of the Disney/Marvel properties, the movie is all over the place. It has to provide exposition about characters and developments associated with various TV shows, in addition to previous movies."
"While it has its fill of entertaining repartee and a truly-inspired set piece featuring Goose and her goslings, the flavorless Villain du jour mixed with half-baked battle scenes places The Marvels among the MCU’s middling offerings."
An agreeable superhero romp that zips by and actually feels good.
The Marvels is so poorly conceived and ineptly executed that it not only makes this a front-runner for the dubious honor of worst movie of the MCU but a contender for the worst superhero movie of all time.
"…just the usual actors adrift in front of green screen nonsense, with barely a hint of daylight or recognisable human behaviour, and lots of eye-rolling dialogue…"
"Even with wall-to-wall action, “The Marvels” feels almost formulaic in its story."
"It's been more than 4 years since the original, and it's like they're trying to decide if it's a gourmet meal or a fast-food combo. At 105 minutes, it's one of Marvel's shortest films, but don't let that fool you. Short doesn't always mean sweet."
"Nia DaCosta is talented, which is why some of this film feels like it wasn’t actively generated by artificial intelligence. However, not even Orson Welles could go in and rescue some of these movies from themselves these days."
"The Marvels is a colorful, clever, joyous film that dodges many -- but certainly not all -- of the issues of its recent predecessors. It keeps the tone light and moves at a quick pace and -- finally -- doesn’t abuse the audience with an onerous runtime."
"The Marvels is disjointed and inconsistent. Post-production editing and VFX was weak and it needed more breathing room to flesh out themes and character arcs. A bright spot; Iman Vellani shines throughout. 
The MCU needs focus on quality over quantity."
"A lot of things happen in The Marvels and most of them are either not understood or fail to make us care, buried by a production model that has run into a dead end. [Full review in Spanish]"
"To spell things out for the cheap seats, The Marvels is not a cinematic abomination, an affront against almighty God, a blight on childhoods everywhere. In point of fact, it’s pretty good!"
"THE MARVELS ... [has] three leads whose company is a joy. ... The villain’s murky motives take time to gel, and there’s word salad for some dialogue, but at its best moments, it’s an entertaining lark with genuine humor and endearing enthusiasm."
The rest is filler and pretty much just another comic book movie.
"It’s a shallow hodgepodge with an underdeveloped villain (Zawe Ashton), but it has quite a few entertaining scenes, including a funny one with lots of cats."
"DaCosta made room for The Marvels to be bright and playful, filled with characters that are impossible not to love."
You get the sense that everyone involved is going through the motions.
"Iman Vellani brings an energetic vibe to a lackluster story in THE MARVELS. However, Vellani along with Brie Larson and Teyonah Parris make a great and entertaining team in a space adventure."
"Feeling more like a drop-in and less like a pillar to build upon. This film feels weighed down by everything but a good story. In the end, I'll give it a grade of C and say that kids will enjoy it, but adults should wait until it hits streaming."
Don’t pull the plug on the MCU just yet.
"This is a mediocre Marvel movie at best. The script is bland...the villain is boring,.. After you leave the theater, in 5 minutes  you wonder, ""now, what did I just see?"".  You forget it that quickly. It's that forgettable."
"The Marvels brings plenty of comedy and screwball oddity to keep the audience on its toes. However, there are flaws that peer through the cracks of the latest Marvel feature."
"A lot of the superhero stuff in The Marvels works really well. The middle section of the film, I can't stand. It feels like a comedy scene ripped from another movie."
"The Marvels is a vibrant and well paced film that's packed with extremely well photographed and choreographed action. It's also brimming with cast chemistry, and rocks a narrative that builds the team *and* the characters as individuals."
I enjoyed The Marvels more than I anticipated for a reason I didn’t expect: Iman Vellani as Ms. Marvel.
The Marvels is fun and entertaining enough with its lighter tone and surface-level gimmicks. Ms. Marvel is the standout by a mile! The weak script and obvious reshoots are continuing issues that has caused the recent decline of the MCU's quality.
"Starts at 11 and stays there. It's exhausting.  So is a script that is curiously both over-plotted and underwritten, and a tone that blithely leaps from high-stakes drama to not-quite-camp enough to save it."
"'The Marvels' takes off with some turbulence but, fueled by great cast chemistry and MCU world-building, lands gracefully."
"The only lasting memorable highlight of all this genuine girl power becomes the voice of Barbra Streisand singing ""Memory"" to a screenful of cavorting cats. Naturally, it is just marvelous!"
"Sure, there’s spurts of enjoyable banter between this new trio … but there’s alarmingly little dramatic material to make it a substantial film."
Breezily enjoyable but not entirely satisfying.
"Instead of teen wannabe-Avenger joining a big girl movie, The Marvels instead has Captain Marvel and Monica Rambeau turn into tween dribble. This movie turns one of its most powerful heroes into a literal Disney Princess."
"“The Marvels” gets by mostly on the chemistry of its core three. Vellani, Parris, and Larson are an amazing team. Of course, it’s Vellani who steals the show with her unbridled joy and charisma."
"It's a charming sequel, hingeing on the most important thing about superheroes: their true strength lies not in their powers, but in their real identities."
"It’s an adequate time waster for fans, but this mid-level Marvel entry ain’t marvelous."
"Surprisingly fun and full of energy, this Marvel film blends three different characters into a great new team."
"... The audience is so tired of so much history and has lowered their expectations so much, that The Marvels, in its 'bare minimum' approach works perfectly in this phase of the franchise. [Full review in Spanish]"
A movie that has an incredible pace and timing. The Marvels uses that to make this among the lighter and more buoyant MCU films and allows for the performers to bounce off each other in fun ways.
"[H]its like the summer popcorn blockbusters we want from Marvel... full of earnest emotion and enthusiasm, with a cool straightforward sci-fi story and plenty of unique action spectacle, and sporting a charming cast with terrific chemistry."
"Ultimately, The Marvels feels like it is just spinning its wheels, keeping these characters in motion long enough to get to the next chapter."
"It’s a story that focuses on well-developed relationships, entertaining locations that don’t overstay their welcome, and a reasonable plot that clocks in at a reasonable running time."
The only thing weaker than the script are the special effects moments. The movie comes across as rushed – despite all the extra time – from words to images.
"They triple-downed on the things that they knew drew eyes without really understanding exactly what made them tick, and we shouldn’t be surprised that we wound up with a movie like The Marvels as a result."
"The latest MCU film The Marvels shines in the stellar chemistry and action between its three leads, despite exhibiting some notable pacing issues."
"""The Marvels"" is a stellar, wildly fun sequel that outshines its predecessor in nearly every way and paves the way for a bright future ahead."
"While the entire cast carries out Nia DeCosta’s vision to the hilt, the standout actor is Iman Vellani."
There's no escaping the fact that most of this is better intended than executed.
"In Larson and Parris, there’s intelligence and strength with each having a flair for sarcasm. Their past life together also helps to add just a touch of the human element. Vellani brings unbridled enthusiasm to the screen."
"The Marvels triumphs as a dazzling spectacle that seamlessly combines action, heart, and a stellar cast."
"Pleasurably lightweight, its story unburdened by the off-screen drama of the studio that made it. The shortest film in the MCU at a runtime of 105 minutes, this sprightly sequel to 2019’s Captain Marvel operates like a breezy road-trip comedy."
The Marvels felt way more like a 90s movie than Captain Marvel; which was set in the 90s. I had fun with this silly film and families should too.
This wobbly addition to the overall saga does not pass muster as either a sequel to the 2019 Captain Marvel solo outing or a sum-of-its-parts team-up.
"The Marvels exhibits a fun, frisky likability I haven’t encountered in an MCU film since Spider-Man: Homecoming."
"While it certainly fails to reaches the heights of MCU's halcyon days, The Marvels also manages to not feel burdened by the franchise's more recent missteps; mostly bolstered by a strong first two acts and the wonderful chemistry of its three leads."
"A zippy, fun superhero tale that doesn’t overstay its welcome."
"This is a film that wears its apparently troubled production, rewrites and reshoots in almost every frame as it leaps and skids and skitters about in every direction all at once. But despite it all, it’s hard not to be won over by its brazen charms..."
"The chemistry among the three leads is one of the only things that really holds this movie together, but the film seems intent on finding ways of sabotaging itself at key moments."
"The Marvels isn’t for them, and I wouldn’t let their poor judgment cloud your desire to see this film. The Marvels is sweet and endearing in a way that takes girl power seriously, without compromising character development or action."
Not as dire as feared. The plot is a stinker. But standouts are Vellani and Shroff.
The Marvels is the most fun any Marvel film has been since the original Guardians and Ant-Man entries.
The unfortunate thing about The Marvels is that it reinforces every negative stereotype the MCU faces. This poorly paced generic superhero movie feels patched together and wholly reworked in postproduction.
"With a great cast, a great premise and some fun and funny moments, the final story is, unfortunately, an anti-climactic version of stories we’ve seen before in the MCU, and “representation” alone can’t save it."
"A messy, confounding story grounds this MCU space odyssey."
Disjointed sequel.
"It is a fairly self-contained, family-friendly, female-forward fantasy that doesn’t buckle to the bro-y burden of self-importance. The Marvels is a good time with some great moments, which is a perfectly wonderful thing for it to be."
"The villain is forgettable, the tone is confused, the resolutions are idiotic and absolutely no one has the energy to see yet another rehash of MCU’s formulaic superhero story, but the kittens are adorable and Iman Vellani is good enough..."
"Somehow, against all odds, the film’s lean 105-minute runtime feels bloated and overwrought, a paint-by-numbers embarrassment from a company that cannot seriously claim to care about art. Its penchant for humor aside, the MCU is now thoroughly a joke."
"Although The Marvels still falls victim to many of the trends plaguing superhero films right now, it delivers more than enough light-hearted fun to scratch your MCU itch."
The Marvels is so much better the stranger it gets.
"What “The Marvels” has going for it, apart from a 105-minute running time... is the energizing presence of Canada’s Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan, Marvel’s first Muslim superhero. She’s almost enough to save a movie that ultimately is beyond redemption."
The good stuff in The Marvels has been hacked and slashed within an inch of its life.
"Even at its most narratively incoherent, The Marvels manages to recapture the sense of pure fun that has been largely missing from the MCU post-Avengers: Endgame."
"The best part is Iman Vellani, as Kamala Khan, as Ms. Marvel.  She is the millennial Peter Parker."
"""Despite its weird tonal shifting and hard-to-follow plot, it’s also not a total franchise destroyer. There’s enough fun and good will within its confines to keep the MCU afloat for another few months."""
"In avoiding the suffocating backstory contained in nearly 120 hours of connected content, The Marvels shows that what was once the MCU's greatest strength has turned into an awkward and especially heavy albatross."
"The Marvels is at its best when our trio is on screen displaying an incredible amount of chemistry, with Vellani being the standout. The attempt to balance this unnecessarily overstuffed plot often falls flat, and the writing for our villain is poor."
A decalogue of unfinished good intentions weighed down by a very clumsy script and some crude effects. [Full review in Spanish]
The Marvels maintains its structure and doesn’t try to function as a springboard to the next Marvel movie or television show. The Marvels gets the space to let the characters just be themselves and for us to better understand what makes them heroes.
The Marvels lights up with the exciting big screen introduction of Kamala Khan portrayed by an exuberant Iman Vellani.
"'The Marvels' Is the MCU's best movie in years. The film excels by separating itself from MCU lore, shortening the runtime and leaning on humor and heart."
Disney+ nuts should get something out of this mash-up but casual cinemagoers will wonder if Marvel has disappeared up its own black hole.
"The Marvels is the film equivalent of a weekend cartoon: light, colorful, with lots of action, natural performances and intelligent humor. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Larson and Parris are wonderful individually and together, but everyone in the production is upstaged by Iman Vellani who is magnetic and charming, channeling her energy into creating a sincere character who captivates."
"A step down from ""Captain Marvel,"" but still a fun, female-centric superhero flick that MCU fans should embrace."
"Proof that a 90-minute blockbuster can soar, The Marvels is bolstered by three terrific leads and might just be the most fun you’ll have at the theater this year, even if it’s not necessarily destined to be remembered as a mighty Marvel classic."
"Writer-director Nia DaCosta produces an impactful picture that skillfully weaves together these features in a snappy hour and 45 minutes, while adding a delightfully surprising musical element."
It's unfair how much this movie leans on the genuinely joyous Iman Vellani to liven up the incomprehensible mess created by corporate filmmaking and multiverse-wide IP-fracking.
"“The Marvels” is a celebration of sisterhood, with three women of different generations and backgrounds coming together to save the universe."
If you can set your expectations low enough you might find some disposable entertainment in “The Marvels”. But that in itself is sad. Especially for those of us who once anxiously counted the days to every new MCU release. Those days seem so long ago.
"Star Brie Larson seems pretty checked out here — almost as checked out as the jokers who came up with the idea of once again tapping the Beastie Boys for the soundtrack. “Hey, they’re on a spaceship! Let’s use ‘Intergalactic!’”"
"The film’s biggest strength is its titular trio: Teyonah, Iman, and Brie."
"With hit or miss visual effects and choppy storyline, The Marvels is not marvelous, but this trip gets the MCU back on track with fast, colorful, explosive action and a power-ful team of superheroes."
"Poised between goofy and godawful and plagued by rewrites and reshoots, this 33rd entry in the Marvel cinematic universe is in serious disrepair. The MCU, once the spawner of glories, is stuck in a rut. The time for a rethink is now."
"In a universe where the movies last well over three hours, the 105 minute runtime of “The Marvels” is as welcome as it is surprising."
Content to be hashtag content.
"My expectations for this movie were pretty low. I didn’t like the Captain Marvel movie when it came out in 2019, and I still rank it as either the second or third worst movie in the franchise. I almost hate to admit it, but I actually enjoyed The Marvels."
"It’s goofy and harmless, and it’s always good to see the female demographic favoured, but, sadly, The Marvels won’t do much to overtly repair the faith many audiences have lost within the MCU."
Nia DaCosta's The Marvels is an delightfully entertaining reminder that alright to have laugh as hard as you cry because it's about the journey.
"DaCosta delivers a family-friendly interplanetary frolic (complete with an impromptu Gilbert and Sullivan-like musical sojourn) filled to the brim with colorful visuals, strong special effects, character-driven humor, and exciting action sequences."
It's average MCU fare.
"The dynamic between the three leads shines when needed and delivers a grand superhero spectacle. Buried underneath all the issues are signs of a much stronger, well-rounded film. The Marvels is a quick, fun superhero romp but falls short of loftier goals."
"The film benefits from having all the usual Marvel mediocrity compressed into such a viewer-friendly running time. It might be just another disposable flash-bang post-content spectacle, but...you’re in, you’re out, no harm done. Well, not much anyway."
"For those who still harbor some hope that the bloated MCU can still produce some fun, lighthearted action-drama, The Marvels is a faint glimmer of hope streaking across a light-polluted sky."
"The Marvels doesn't totally escape the tonal issues and legacy issues of The Multiverse Saga, but its three leads cover most of its flaws."
"The 33rd entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Nia DaCosta's 'The Marvels' does something that this series hasn't done in a while. It has a little fun. It feels more like 'Iron Man' than it does 'Eternals.'"
"The strengths of the film (character’s chemistry, humor, Ms Marvel) overcome the multiple weaknesses of the film (certain cringy sequences, weak villain, pacing) to deliver a mildly enjoyable film."
"A large portion of The Marvels feels designed to troll the fanboys, and god bless DaCosta for that."
"The superhero is as bored as we are, but the Marvel machine grinds on."
The Marvels is a fans-only endeavor -- and it remains to be seen whether all of them will be eager to sign on.
"A jumble of personal and interpersonal conflicts, tiresome talk of quantum bands and jump points, and left field attempts at humor that play like discarded ideas from the Guardians of the Galaxy series."
"The Marvels feels safely bland at a time when Marvel needs to take some chances. Because despite featuring a space-faring hero who can majestically streak into the stars, those heroics come in a movie that only intermittently gets off the ground."
"Nothing much happens in it that hasn't already been seen, and when it ends it opens the floodgates for a new string of movies and shows. [Full review in Spanish]"
"What happened to superhero movies? How did a genre rooted in astonishment, weirdness, and wonder become a byword for the normative, the familiar, and the mundane?"
"For those who are looking for something other than the usual CGI superpowers, it has some satisfying pleasures."
"THE MARVELS is just okay. It pretends to be about so much more, but its uneven script, unmemorable villain, rushed resolutions, and wild swings exposes it in the end.
The three lead actresses have great chemistry, but it's not enough to save this movie."
"As someone who is uninitiated with Captain Marvel's world, I was wholly confused and unsatisfied with this film."
"This film is brilliantly original, as the all-woman production team creates scenarios that are outside the usual. The comic book geeks out there can finally take a date, because all can enjoy. That is, of course, if they can get a date. Hy-oh! Cats! Brie!"
The worlds of television and film collide in this mediocre serving of spectacle and comedy.
"While contempt has not yet set in, the familiarity of the Marvel Films is starting to wear on me."
"Despite impressive stunt choreography in 'The Marvels', the film grapples with significant shortcomings that stunt work alone cannot overshadow."
"The new Marvel movie had everything against it. And yet, it may be the answer to the studio's mini-crisis... [Full review in Spanish]"
"The trio has a chemistry together that makes them enjoyable to watch, with Kamala’s unceasing positivity one of the film’s high points."
"The Marvels marks a positive step forward in reviving the tired MCU by delivering fresh comedy, fast action and strong character development. Marvel – more of this, please."
"[Its] failure to build depth and purpose into either its storytelling or characters renders The Marvels a flashy but hollow experience, less a satisfying event movie than a determined corporate attempt at damage control."
"There are tasks, mandates, and missions to be accomplished in a throughline that's hard to follow. [Full review in Spanish]"
The takeaway from “The Marvels” for Marvel Studios is that it’s ok to make a stand-alone movie that’s nothing more than an entertaining romp through space with enjoyable characters. Sometimes simpler is better.
"Far superior than the first 2019 film. The chemistry between the 3 main leads is Marvelous! The action beats are fun, well choreographed, and as expected the film is funny. However the story, and villain are some of the worst in the MCU."
"It's a mess that only grows messier, with a drab eyesore of a final act in which character decisions are untethered from anything which came before, with the express intent of setting up future movies rather than effectively bringing this one to a close."
"The Marvels excels with its ensemble cast and their chemistry, creative action set pieces, some impressive visual effects, stunning costumes, and well-timed humor, which all together push the movie into safe harbor."
"As an enjoyable entry into the MCU, The Marvels proudly celebrates being unapologetically wild and funny."
"Inferior to ""Captain Marvel"" in almost every way, especially its technical craftsmanship, the always messy and often baffling film is a representation of the worst side of today's MCU: Disjointed, unfocused and inconsistent. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Kind of like your neighbor's overstuffed Christmas lawn display, it's a garish, nonsensical, mismatched cacophony that tries too hard on every level, and achieves excellence on none of them. Even the superhero cast can't save it."
There might have been a good movie buried somewhere in The Marvels but what I saw was a big mess.
"At its best, The Marvels is a delightful buddy comedy about three very different women learning to work together as a team—like the MCU’s more wholesome take on DC’s anarchic Birds of Prey."
Maybe the most important thing is that these three lead actresses seem to take palpable joy in one another’s company.
"The Marvels' is a disposable diversion and at least seems to be aware of it, hence its tight running time. [Full review in Spanish]"
... The plot is simple and more straightforward. [Full review in Spanish]
"The Marvels gets tons right. It has some wonderfully mad sci-fi shenanigans, inventive action scenes, a nicely compact plot, solid character development, and tons of on-point humour, but the reason it works comes down to our three main heroes."
"Iman Vellani’s Kamala Khan (is) the heart of The Marvels... (the film) strives for and succeeds in the best balance between plot points, character interaction, story weight, and pure entertainment… all within a runtime of under two hours. ‘Nuff said."
"On paper, The Marvels could have been a harmonious coalition of three popular new characters, but its generic filter sandpapers away any verve or stylistic energy the three previous projects had."
"It might not have the overwhelming impact of an Endgame or even a Guardians 3, but this is the MCU back on fast, funny form."
It’s almost as if the suits at Marvel Studios know it doesn’t matter if their movies are any good.
"Vellani, the series’ most charming and encouraging new performer in years, shows that she (and her plucky character) are ready to carry the Avengers for many films to come."
"Arguably the nadir of the franchise, at least thus far—a farrago of repetitious fight scenes, mediocre effects, a jumbled narrative, weird humor, and characters that are either bland or irritating."
"Most of the time the film is as displaced and fractured as its leads, bouncing from character introspection to family comedy to musical with a manic pride. DaCosta and company have A LOT of ideas of what The Marvels could be."
"A superhero movie clearly made and produced by people who have read their Marvel comics and also maybe their Archies. It feels like it was made for actual comic fans, which has of course always included teen girls."
"If this series is going to require so much homework, the payoff should be more worthwhile than this."
"Iman Vellani delivers a warm, big-hearted performance that stands out in a sea of kaleidoscopic CGI. Her relationships with her family, Captain Marvel and Rambeau are lovely, tethering this otherworldly movie firmly on planet earth."
"Clocking in at a brief hundred minutes and change, The Marvels is quick, breezy, and often quite fun. All three actresses have played these roles before, and there’s a lived-in quality to the performances even when they’re coming from different worlds."
"Being a huge fan of the source material, Nia DaCosta leans into the wacky. There’s tonnes of unique and exciting camera work, cinematography and worldbuilding. The incredibly choreographed action feels like part of the script, rather than an afterthought."
"One of the most FUN post-Infinity Saga instalments. It’s got everything we want – great characters with fantastic chemistry; an exciting story; and entertaining, creative action sequences. The lead trio are absolutely electric together."
What was once whiz-bang imaginative and sky-high thrilling – disarming despite its armaments – has imploded spectacularly. And Marvel – and The Marvels – has no one to blame but themselves.
"The shortest MCU film it may be, but The Marvels has so much on its plate versus time on its clock, that it is a movie in a hurry. This despite its occasional rest stops of silliness (which are the movie's saving grace)."
"... the overall frequency of ""The Marvels,"" which is to keep it loose, get weird, and make some magic."
Here is a film that proves that superhero fatigue hasn’t won just yet. It just takes a fresh and exciting film like this to get us all hooked again.
"DaCosta fully and unapologetically embraces the girliness of her movie. There's a musical number, a dreamboat prince, and oodles of cuddly kittens, all of which add a little tongue-in-cheek nod to the overall femininity that's present here."
Nia DaCosta’s The Marvels is ultimately both the worst and the best of the MCU’s instincts wrapped in a very cute package. Only a super-grinch would deny the infectiousness of Kamala Khan and what her energy brings to an increasingly exhausting genre.
"THE MARVELS is fine entertainment, though it’s not exceptional."
Much of the movie is an exercise in silliness bordering on the ridiculous. But I have no doubts that devoted MCU fans will rejoice with THE MARVELS.
"A sludge of story and CGI-soaked chaotic chaos that gives no character the space to be a real person, which is endlessly frustrating given the charm on display from the ensemble, especially Iman Vellani's Ms. Marvel"
"Actually lots of fun, and somehow better than Captain Marvel. The newest MCU entry is fast, fidgety and kooky, with some cool action/choreography. And Iman Villani elevates everything. [Full review in Spanish]"
"I'm not gonna lie, I loved The Marvels! It's the most fun I've had in theaters in a while. Iman Vellani is a superstar."
"The Marvels is a rocky ride that feels crowded by MCU compromises, which undermines the star power of its cast and the talents of its director."
"The Marvels is FUN, FAST and an ABSOLUTE DELIGHT! Iman Vellani steals every scene and is the future of the MCU."
"The Marvels might still carry the mess and underwhelming emotional punch of the recent MCU releases, but undeniably brings the fun to provide an overall enjoyable MCU feature."
"The movie mostly works because director Nia DaCosta and her fellow writers, Megan McDonnell, Elissa Karasik and Zeb Wells, flaunt and embrace the absurdities that crop up throughout the feature."
"Fitfully entertaining but spectacularly forgettable, The Marvels is nowhere near enough of a marvel to save Marvel."
"This extraordinarily untidy film was recalled for reshoots earlier in the year, and it shows. Poorly edited, difficult to follow, The Marvels is barely in a releasable state."
"[Iman Vellani] has this infectious optimism... the rest of the movie feels like an exercise in complacency, and a testament to the fact that the MCU needs to take a break."
"The Marvels overcomes a shaky start, delighting Marvel fans with creativity, upbeat pacing, and character development."
"It does feel like the filmmakers behind it have found the right mix of comedy, action and drama. Add to that some genuine character growth and look and feel that strongly resembles Green Lantern and this turns out to be a pretty decent film."
"Director DaCosta builds an effective, diverse team-up that might help to steady the franchise ship if only fans will embrace its silly, off-kilter take on the superhero universe."
"As tentpole entertainment, it feels inconsequential, if slightly diverting. To put it in corporate speak, it could have been an email."
"[It's} a lower-tier MCU installment, but the quality is serviceable enough to keep you diverted. That’s a mild endorsement for one segment of a vast franchise, but if they keep making negligible items like this, the franchise may peter out entirely."
"The Marvels is a film that does ten things wrong for every three things it gets perfectly right, but in the grand scheme of things it still remains rather light and likeable."
Vellani's Ms. Marvel charms but latest MCU disappointment better served as Disney Plus filler.
"DaCosta understood the assignment, and she and her team delivered. The Marvels might not cure everyone of superhero fatigue, but it's the most true to its comic origins as any this studio has produced."
"Tonally, “The Marvels” embraces the goofy nature of a sci-fi superhero movie aimed at a female audience."
The Marvels should be called The Debacles. This superhero disaster is proof that a bloated budget and talented cast members can't save a low-quality movie that is an embarrassment to everyone involved. Tacky cartoons have better dialogue than this mess.
"Even though there are some fun scenes with The Marvels trio, I’d be hard-pressed to recommend this to anyone who isn’t an MCU superfan."
"While it’s full of all the expected Marvel metaphysical head-spinning... it’s also unexpectedly endearing, a pleasant popcorn-flavored joy ride into the cosmos, with three likable heroes as our guides."
Kamala comes into her own here and works really well at meeting her heroes. Both the actress and the character are clearly so excited to be in a big Marvel movie that you can't help but get a little swept up in it yourself.
"Thankfully, the movie clocks in at a mere 105 minutes. “The Marvels” doesn’t have much to say, but at least it says it quickly."
"To be clear, no one is more surprised than me! You know how badly I wanted to title this review Swing and a Ms.?"
"There are soaring highs fighting to break out from an overall cluttered movie with a sloppy plot that you’ll struggle to care about. But what does work, works incredibly well."
"Director and co-writer Nia DaCosta’s agreeable weirdo of a movie has a few things going for it. It’s genuinely peculiar, its nervous energy keeping things reasonably diverting. Also there’s an extended scene of Flerken."
The Marvels excites you to see the main characters again first and where the overall “phase” is going as the cherry on top. I feel the MCU has lost some of that in the turnover but has regained some of that luster with the three they showcase here.
"Full of laughs and action, The Marvels gives me hope that the MCU is headed higher, further, faster."
"A disjointed, clunky and tonally uneven mess with not nearly enough surprises or palpable thrills."
"The Marvels is far from perfect. But, it’s nonetheless entertaining. It’s exciting to see three women superheroes actually work together  and actually complementing each others’ individual powers to get the job done."
"The Marvels swings wildly between CGI-fueled action scenes, campy humor, and slivers of emotional gravitas. Banner cast chemistry between the likable leads lifts a convoluted plot with a dull and dreary villain."
I was ready to love The Marvels. But it was like ordering filet mignon and getting some dinner rolls and a plate of overcooked mixed veggies instead. I love good dinner rolls. But they aren’t a main course.
"The Marvels provides enough energy and excitement to satisfy the casual comic book movie observer, even if it's fleeting. The Marvels is a delightful entry in a long line of cinematic offerings from a depleted movie studio."
"Good news, everyone! Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige finally seems over his Rick and Morty obsession, and judging by The Marvels, has moved on to Star Trek."
"There are even hints of the anarchic spirit of a Gremlins 2, but The Marvels still is beholden to a greater cinematic universe, so it can't go too far overboard. That it even strays as far as it does is a breakthrough."
The Marvel Cinematic Universe is now officially on life support.
"At under two-hours, light-hearted in tone, and skipping long expository scenes in favor of fun, 'The Marvels' is a refreshingly different than a lot of recent MCU fare."
"""Regardless of any hiccups, ""The Marvels"" satisfyingly gets its larger message across, that women should lean on each other, and know they're higher, further, faster — and stronger — together."""
"It’s just another straight down the middle product that ignored each and every opportunity it had along the way to be something better. If that no longer is working for audiences, perhaps it's time to rethink the formula."
"The Marvels is far from the best Marvel Studios has to offer, but it's difficult not to get swept up in its infectious energy... to a point."
"The Marvels is cute, weird, and wonky with PowerPuff vibes. I’m good with that."
"[The Marvels] is hilarious and zany, introducing us to new worlds and storylines that reminded me of the wacky comic book plots I’ve always loved. There’s so much action and girl power, especially as the trio learn to work together."
"In an era where the Marvel Cinematic Universe frequently shuttles between multiverse escapades and interplanetary conflicts, Nia DaCosta‘s ""The Marvels"" emerges as a breath of fresh air."
"With the possible exception of 2017’s “Thor: Ragnarok,” Marvel hasn’t gotten as consistently funny and light-hearted as it does in “The Marvels,” director Nia DaCosta’s rollicking and charmingly ridiculous variation on Marvel’s superhero action genre."
"The Marvels definitely stumbles with a few important elements like its early pacing. But the risks The Marvels takes succeed far more often than they backfire, which is exactly the sort of promising energy the larger franchise has been lacking lately."
"Except for a very funny scene set to Memory, the emblematic theme of the musical Cats, this is a bland movie, barely a kickoff for something presumed to be much bigger. [Full review in Spanish]"
Call it being chopped up in post-production or just a Marvel studio problem but The Marvels is far from approaching anything Marvelous.
"This movie is a proper showcase for Iman Vellani and will hopefully send viewers who skipped Ms. Marvel back to check that series out. While Brie Larson is still good as Captain Marvel, she cannot rescue this movie from itself."
"The Marvels isn't the franchise-dooming disaster that social media scuttlebutt (and the film's lackluster marketing) have alluded to, but it will not save Kevin Feige's billion-dollar baby anytime soon."
"Horrible CGI, a paper thin villain, Kamala is next level annoying....Jar Jar level, and a cluttered plot . The writing feels very first draft. Capt Marvel is the only saving grace of the bunch as her personality is an improvement from the first film."
"While it’s largely successful in what it does, it’s hard to escape a nagging feeling of over-familiarity with a pastiche of a villain audiences won’t remember and a narrative arc cut we’ve seen in other previous installments."
"A narrative and visual jumble, and the clearest evidence yet that maybe we don’t need some sort of Marvel product in theaters or on streaming at all times."
"Fanservice to its core, this inclusive chapter in Captain Marvel's story is a movie made for fangirls. It's too bad that The Marvels couldn't go higher, further, faster."
"It’s a lively, relatively simple character-driven ride through the cosmos that makes up for its plot weaknesses with personality."
"While Iman Vellani is an absolute delight as Ms. Marvel and the film is superficially fun, the story and tone are a complete mess. It feels like big chunks of the movie are missing. The movie never figures out what it wants to be or where it's going."
"""The Marvels"" is an electric blast of welcome, pure, and multiplied girl power."
"'The Marvels' is the same movie you've seen before, not necessarily done better or worse, but just the same"
"It’s finally official: The MCU has an identity crisis. This film is a goofy, schizophrenic, cluttered mishmash of tone and pace with a script so paper-thin that the story hardly justifies the merciful Marvel Studios’ 100-minute runtime."
"The Marvels is a lot of fun, and at 1 hour 45 minutes short and sweet. The chemistry between the three leads is fantastic! Plus the action scenes are inventive. It may not have broad appeal, but with some it will really connect."
"Thankfully, director Nia DaCosta and stars, Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris and Iman Vellani, seem far less interested in saving Marvel, and instead, are focused on telling a delightful adventure with great characters."
The Marvels is an uproariously fun and action-packed comic book movie that's made all the more delightful by the heartwarming dynamic of the leads.
"Fans of earlier films in the series will probably take a hard pass here, but for those of us who enjoy a bit of satirical silliness, The Marvels manages to be both funny and endearing."
"The chance to feature three lead female characters is worthwhile, but these personas are so poorly scripted that audiences will surely feel the grating lack of chemistry and creativity."
"Fresh, funny, and one of Marvel’s sillier films, The Marvels allows itself to have fun -- making for a movie that is exhilarating to watch while still giving fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe what they’ve come to know and love from the franchise."
Director Nia DaCosta delivers a winner thanks to a formidable heroic trio.
"There’s a place in the MCU for wackjob silliness. But in “The Marvels,” the bits of absurd comedy tend to feel strained, because they clash with the movie’s mostly utilitarian tone."
A solid contender for the worst Marvel film yet ... To say The Marvels is hard to watch would be to risk understatement. It’s not just that it’s not very good. It is hard to watch in the sense that a tree is hard to defibrillate.
"Thematically and where performances are concerned, the film is aces. Plot wise, it fumbles. But it’s still enjoyable because of the leading women who undoubtedly poured everything they have into all their scenes."
"Like a good episode in a lousy season, The Marvels reminds the fans why they’re watching — and it might even be someone’s favorite installment in the ongoing story."
A  superhero movie clearly made and produced by people who have never read a Marvel comic book but read Archie instead.
"If you thought “Eternals” and “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” were low points for the limping Marvel Cinematic Universe, strap in for the ride to abject misery that is “The Marvels.”"
"A film begins with the script. It quickly becomes abundantly clear that the problems with The Marvels start with a lumpen, exposition-laden, charmless, and emotionally flat one ... and it's all downhill from there."
"Marvel Studios’ latest film in Phase 5 of the franchise is genre-bending, mind-melding, and found-family-building joy—with an all-timer post credits scene."
"It is all, of course, entirely ridiculous, but presented with such likable humour and brio, particularly the Marvels’ visit to a planet where everyone sings instead of speaks."
The messiest Marvel movie.
"“Higher, further, faster” ran the original Captain Marvel’s rousing tagline. “Have we reached the bottom yet?” would be an apt one for this."
"Not everything has to be “Citizen Kane.” But there’s no reason to settle for fan-servicing junk, either. Sorry, but “The Marvels” is where I draw the line."
Struggles to stay coherent for a good deal of its relatively brief running time.
"While Marvel’s been busy flooding us with endless, exhaustive content, DaCosta’s movie offers us the one thing that made this franchise work in the first place – heroes we actually want to root for."
"The Marvels frequently undersells its key moments, but the engaging chemistry between the leads and DaCosta’s snappy pacing ensure that it’s never less than entertaining."
"As is often the case with Marvel’s girl power attempts, it feels a little pandering in all the wrong places and doesn’t really engage with any specific or unique female point of view."
"Like Carol Danvers herself, and hopefully like many of the movie's viewers, The Marvels seems to understand on an unspoken level that it doesn't have to carry the weight of the world alone. The movie can just be silly, sweet, and imperfect."
"Ms. Marvel & Monica Rambeau carried this film but, they managed to make Captain Marvel a more interesting character. It’s not perfect but it's self aware & better than the original & just a action packed space adventure w/3 characters w/great chemistry!"
"As successful as its biggest, wildest swings are, it’d really be nice if the plotting of The Marvels lived up to those elements. That said, those other elements are hard to oversell."
"Despite its progressive bona fides, “The Marvels” is so fueled by fan service and formula, like pretty much everything in the MCU these days, that it gives short shrift to such basics as narrative comprehension."
"The Marvels feels like a return to form for the Marvel Cinematic Universe as it is a film focused on telling the story of its three leading ladies and not future endeavors, and those three ladies are all a ton of fun to watch."
"Nia DiCosta's direction of The Marvels brings solid chemistry and an all-around fun tone that allows a powerhouse trio of Carol, Monica, and Kamala to shine on screen."
"“The Marvels” is that rare superhero adventure seemingly tailor-made for cat lovers, people really into body-swapping shenanigans and those who live for jubilant song-and-dance numbers."
"But here again the ambition is limited, the anarchy formulaic."
"If 'The Marvels' can withstand the rumors and build word of mouth for its engaging, fun and exciting production, then hopefully it can signify the beginning of the next phase of Marvel fun."
"One character carries the weight of the film, while the rest feel hollow and uninteresting. That middling head-scratching post-credit scene can't redeem this."
"There is sugar-rush charm to at least some of the movie. DaCosta, who previously directed smart horror remake Candyman, is a genuine talent, giving vibrancy to the sitcommy Khans and a sturdy whump to fight scenes."
One of the first movies Marvel has put out in a long time that feels willing to be as weird and enjoyably stupid as the genre allows. This might be Marvel's first cult classic.
"Iman Vellani and Goose are the stars here, but an undercooked main plot and maybe the worst villain the MCU has had yet sink this thrown together mixed bag despite it being a refreshingly diverse female-led superhero flick."
"While this film is a win for diversity, the plot is not particularly interesting and under director Nia DaCosta the tonal shifts fail and the comedic timing is off."
"All told, The Marvels is a fun, funny and snappily paced, but ultimately slight, movie outing."
"Neither as funny nor as engaging and warm as it tries to be, despite the best efforts of the talented director Nia DaCosta and a trio of gifted and enormously likable leads in Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris and Iman Vellani."
"Dull, bland villain. The chemistry between Carol and Monica is very lacking. The story is all over the place."
The story emits a strong whiff of who cares?
"If “The Marvels” shows us anything, it’s a fleeting glimpse of what the MCU could look like, if only it was superheroic enough to try."
DaCosta’s kinetic direction and intimate storytelling style lets audiences see this trio — whose lives collide in unexpected ways — from new and entertaining vantage points.
"Both funny and heartfelt, Nia DaCosta’s MCU debut will have you asking when she and her leading ladies are coming back immediately after the credits roll."
"In the end, The Marvels is a mess despite it’s leads trying their hardest to hold it all together."
"The Marvels is a step up from the original Captain Marvel in almost every way. Personality and Style from Nia DaCosta brings this added layer to this breezy, light, and entertaining blockbuster."
