review
A sassy comedy that raises questions for people of all ages about what it means to frame your life as a quest.
"Barbie is feminism 101, but for the global mainstream audience who have been served nothing but depoliticised superheroes for decades, the directness of Barbie's feminism is an essential step for reclaiming the soul of the Hollywood blockbuster."
"[Barbie] takes our complicated real-world relationship to Barbie and uses it as a metaphor to interrogate the impossibly high, often contradictory standards women are held to in our male-dominated culture."
To watch Barbie is to feel totally and completely seen. And that's what makes Barbie worthy of the wait.
"The laughs are plentiful and the set design is eye-popping, but what makes Barbie truly work is its deft tackling of numerous themes."
"Barbie boasts impressive production design, costumes, and a pair of leads up to the task of bringing their respective dolls to life, but sadly comes up a little short when it comes to its screenplay."
"The film’s boldness and, frankly, weirdness, allows Barbie to become a successful sum of its parts. It’s a film that clearly has something to say and doesn’t want audiences to get caught up in the fact that it’s a doll at the center of it."
"One of the best films of the year in cinematographic terms, probably the best comedy that we have seen in a long time, and an extraordinarily entertaining product that promotes the value of searching for a more cohesive society. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Gerwig and Baumbach lure viewers with the promise of squeaky clean pop-culture fun, all while Trojan-horsing a stranger, more complex battle of the sexes."
Barbie is a dazzling new instant classic and unlike anything you’ve seen before. It’s the perfect summer movie and one of the funniest of the year.
"Though presented as a funny comedy about the doll that we all know, in reality, it is a very fine and brave portrait of what it means to be a man and a woman today. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Early-on, ""Barbie” resembles those Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello beach party movies. It's breezily photographed in pop art colors by Rodrigo Prieto. In Barbieland, the houses don’t have walls and everybody seems happy. Mellow whimsy prevails."
"It explores the frailties of masculinity and the post-feminist struggle to escape the matrix of utopian feminism, even though Barbie and Ken's journey of self-discovery sometimes misses the point of fun. [Full review in Spanish]"
It's the rare film that's as intelligent as it is entertaining.
"...[Greta] Gerwig’s pink, plastic epic is infused with its director’s indie spirit and far more cognizant of the toy’s complicated legacy than you might expect."
"The film gets a little lost at times, as if it had too many storylines to play with and won’t let any of them go... But there are many great jokes in the film."
Greta Gerwig has created a coming-of-age feminist self-aware masterpiece in Barbie with a heart of gold that both subverts and matches expectations.
"Barbie isn’t as streamlined as my favorite girl comedies, but it’s more thematically ambitious than many of them too. And I’ll take flawed ambition over plastic perfection any day of the week."
"All is peaceful and idyllic, that is until Stereotypical Barbie inexplicably blurts out a passing thought about death."
"Greta Gerwig's summer blockbuster is well worth watching, but fails to reach the storytelling heights of her previous work."
"This funny, eye-catching film sports pitch-perfect performances from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, paying tribute to the iconic toy while skewering the patriarchy and feminist window-dressing."
Gerwig didn’t just make a great movie; it’s something that will buckle the knees and tug hard on the heartstrings for generations of viewers. This is the work of a marvelous filmmaker who knows exactly what she is and wants to do.
"Serious and lightweight at the same time, Barbie proves surprisingly successful, much like the doll that inspired."
"Barbie is not a perfect movie, but it is a conversation, and a conversation worth having. For me, Barbie brought the unexpected pleasure of finding shared experiences in our fractured, factious age."
"While these existential questions are refreshing in a mainstream movie, the real magic is found in how they move toward maturity: through imperfection and mistake."
The story is simple and sweet.
"[Gerwig] and partner Noah Baumbach have penned a very clever script that packs in humour, sadness, satire and a powerful feminist message."
"Barbie, the movie, might make a few missteps as a feminist polemic, but it largely succeeds as a gleefully subversive look at the dehumanizing effects of inequality and how a simple idea can change the world."
Barbie is full of laughs and lots of pink! But the one thing that stood out to me the most were the messages within the movie. While the film was very meta in many ways it brought a lot of  much needed women's rights issues to the forefront!
"In the new film, “Barbie,” Greta Gerwig paints a world where anything is possible, where girls can realize ambitions, dream big and call the shots – not unlike the activity that has swirled around the toy for decades."
Barbie‘s downfall is triggered by a midsection that grows less and less interesting (and more and more grating) as time progresses...
"The film is a wicked satire of all that the Barbie franchise stands for; at the same time, it is never mean spirited. In fact, it’s a celebration. A balancing act for the ages."
"I can’t imagine seeing it a second time, because everything is right there on the surface (except for the Mattel Easter eggs, I guess), easy to grasp and easy enough to enjoy. And that’s it."
"Greta Gerwig, seeking to forge a distinguished persona for Barbie, one that steps beyond the corporate machinations and transnational interests of Mattel, secures a delicate equilibrium that noticeably tips in her favor."
There's a winking sense of humor that I really enjoyed.
"It is in many ways reverential to Barbie, and in other ways subversive. It's kind of amazing that it manages to do both."
"This first live-action Barbie film is not, as some may assume, for kids, but more for the teenagers and adults who have played with the doll in the past"
"This is the only Barbie movie that could have been made, and though colorful that makes it a little bland and a little sad, like staring deeply into a bowl of Lucky Charms."
"The first forty minutes were hilarious and then it started to taper off a bit, particularly things with America's daughter. The leads did an amazing job and the musical numbers were weird and fun."
"Kudos to Greta Gerwig for balancing a talented cast with different comedy sensibilities into a cohesive, hilarious and thought provoking film that made me examine my own biases."
"Greta Gerwig’s pink-plastic jab at the patriarchy is one of the most subversive films of the year, possibly the decade. It's also one of the most philosophically rich."
Barbie is a good time at the movies. The nearly two-hour runtime flies by and is jam-packed with incredible set pieces and endless imagination.
"Gerwig’s pacey direction of her own co-written script delivers 114 minutes of neon-pink absurdity, big musical numbers, genuine belly laughs and sly, self-aware digs at popular culture."
"At its core, Gerwig’s film delivers a surprisingly strong emotional hook in Barbie’s conundrum of being caught between her idyllic plastic life and the ever-changing, complicated real world."
"There are many references that the movie makes to aspects of pop culture, and to discover them all one would need to give it a second look [Full review in Spanish]"
BARBIE is a cinematic phenomenon that pulls off the rarest of feats: using a doll to make a striking commentary about gender politics. Greta Gerwig levels up as a director and writer with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling delivering career best performances.
"It's hard to understand getting angry about a film like Barbie. It's such a joyously bonkers, rip-roaringly hilarious, and yes very pinkly-coloured piece of pure unbridled entertainment."
This Barbie movie might be too candied and flamboyant but is certainly not silly.
"Barbie, while far from perfect, is an unexpectedly delightful breath of fresh and campy air with a reasonably well-delivered feminist message."
"With a final line that's one of the best in the business, Barbie shows it's possible to both deconstruct the ideal and keep the manufacturer onside with a script that is a masterful balancing act, some subtle, smart direction and some terrific actors"
Barbie is a small miracle. [Full review in Portuguese]
Signaling the reach and limitations of a feminist point of view beleaguered by a consumerism that assimilates and trivializes social causes... the film simultaneously mirrors it and questions it blandly. [Full review in Spanish]
"If Barbie were made 15 or even 10 years ago I would have eaten it up like a perfectly toasted waffle with a dollop of cream. Instead, being feministsplained about the patriarchy & gender inequality every 5 minutes soured me to it"
Better than I could have ever expected a Barbie movie to be.
"It’s unfortunate that in a film where she goads her characters to find themselves, director Greta Gerwig's creative voice is flattened out by a corporation’s."
"This is what happens when you don't do a satire correctly. Barbie is what happens when capitalism dictates messages about girlhood, feminism, and gender inequality."
Gracefully combines the lightness of cotton candy entertainment with the cleverness of a well-crafted plot
"Barbie is Gerwig’s weirdest, funniest and most bonkers film to date. Within the studio system, we should all be very grateful it exists."
"When I became a father I searched for movies that would show my daughter positive role models, and it was tough going. Barbie makes up for lost time and should warm the hearts of parents and daughters alike."
"...portrays the message that men need women but women, most of the time, only need themselves, but I doubt most will be offended as the harshness is done in a loving and humorous manner that we men are not supposed to understand in the first place."
"In a world where blockbuster films are surrounded by digital landscapes, Barbie’s devotion to practical production is outstanding."
"It might not land perfectly for every single member of its audience, but at its core, “Barbie” is a movie packed with joy, and a blast of fun at the movies this summer."
"Barbie performs a great trick: it takes in crowds aching for fantasy and switches the script, telling them that reality and their flawed, beautiful selves is all they have to love."
"Barbie is, at best, half a movie."
"If you don’t like one gag, stick around, another is on the way."
"The Barbie flick struts self-awareness, luring us all in. But humor falters by act three, like an SNL skit past its prime. Fear not, for Ryan Gosling's charismatic portrayal of Ken almost rescues the day... but not quite!"
Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken were superb casting. They both can project a very plastic emotional shell or be internally damaged when needed.
"Race, culture, sexuality and other parts of identity were left in its original packaging lowering the overall impact and highlighting the heavy handed focus on the gender binary."
"It is clever and funny at times. The look of the movie, with its vibrant Barbieland colors, is a wonderful change from the bland way most movies look nowadays."
"Slathered with satire that isn’t sugar-coated, Barbie’s message hits hard."
"The film tries to do too much, but we can’t be anything less than deeply impressed that anyone came up with too many smart, funny, biting things to say in a movie about Barbie, of all things."
"“Barbie” is the perfect brand to tell this story. An unexpected exploration of the value of being a human being, how we shouldn’t be solely defined by our gender and the pros and cons of both matriarchy and patriarchy"
"This film is pink on estrogen! It is a smart, fun and important look at an American Icon. It humorously portrays male figures like Ken as accessories in Barbie Land, but the focus remains on highlighting Barbie's importance rather than vilifying men."
"Barbie has a lot of good qualities. ... The problem is that a little amount of Barbie and Ken goes a long way, and the film eventually comes off as one-note. Barbie could have been a great Saturday Night Live skit."
"A fearless feminist manifesto that’s perfectly wrapped in a pretty pink bow, the film is a defiant, thought-provoking, brutally honest exploration of the female experience."
"Margot Robbie stars as Stereotypical Barbie with Ryan Gosling is her Ken, but the film doesn’t live up to the hype."
"Gosling walks away with the film, both through the patriarchy and his hilariously sincere performance. Overall, it’s one hell of an achievement. It’s just not the one we were looking for."
"The good news is that Barbie is an excellent film and is possibly the cinematic event of the summer. In leading their team, Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig have made a smart and sunny blockbuster with something to say."
"In trying to say too much, the film winds up not saying much at all."
"Greta Gerwig tackles philosophical questions that are more daunting than a film based on a children’s toy can handle. It results in a strange, uneven, but beautiful movie."
"The film goes beyond an ideological corset, yet it remains faithful to its framework as a comedy about marketing fiction. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Just enjoy the performances by fine actors having a ball in fabulous costumes on outrageous sets. And if you or your little sisters come away with some meaty food for thought, more power to it. It can be many things to many people. That's the glory of it."
Much deeper than its superficial pink packaging. Greta Gerwig cleverly comments on the complex gender dynamics of a popular toy brand that has so many inherent contradictions. Listen closely and you’ll hear the box office shouting: “Closer I am to fine!”
"Barbie is strained and smug without much wit. One should bear in mind that Mattel, with revenue of $42 billion in 2022, partnered with Warner Bros. on the making of the movie."
"Sadly, Barbie isn’t the brilliant film that many hoped it would be. The cheesy comedy often gets in the way of what could have been a very important storyline and to be honest many will expect more from a Gerwig film."
A high-heeled Trojan horse from which it espouses all matter of feminist nonsense that is eye-rolling at best and sexist at worst.
"Barbie, the doll, not the movie, is made of contradictions and Gerwig has done a mighty fine job of giving those contradictions the sparkliest, shiniest, warmest visual avatar."
Greta Gerwig serves up a frothy confection of fashion and fun coupled with searing social critique of the iconic doll in the movie Barbie.
"With a clever opening sequence and an excellent cast, Barbie manages to overcome cumbersome plotting and feminist pieties to provide a delightful spectacle of funny moments that add up to something pretty good."
"Amid all the pink, there’s plenty of room for a think."
"Through the film’s satirical insights about modern society, the director asks all the right questions."
Barbie was solid -- it was a good time [with a] great message.
'Barbie' actually turns examining the toy’s impact on generations of girls and women into its whole raison d’être.
"For every nod and wink it offers the audience, there is also an urgent call to attention simmering beneath those barbed and razor-sharp quips and puns."
Is Barbie a goofy romp or a heady subversion of genre?
"The film may skew towards girls but there’s more than enough story, laughs and pratfalls for boys and their dads to embrace."
"Gerwig’s satire and the comedic chops of Robbie and, especially, Gosling fall into perfect rhythm once Barbie and Ken leave the candy-colored comforts of Barbie Land and Ken discovers the patriarchy."
"Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig have created an edgy, existential, empowering comedy-adventure that cleverly exposes our sexist societal shortcomings."
The story of Barbieland’s descent into a patriarchal nightmare ... fails at the most basic level of prompting laughs. This is a mild problem for a film that is ostensibly a comedy.
"BARBIE was always destined to deconstruct the long-lasting stereotypes around perfectionism with Barbie, but the way Greta Gerwig does that still blew away all expectations."
"Barbie is a lunatic fable about girlhood, good vibes, and going for it that proposes self-acceptance as the most radical act of self-love, told by a doll—person? Yes!—that is positive and problematic at the same time."
Barbie is vibrant and refreshingly creative with its heavy-handed messaging. It's a shame they fell a bit short with bringing the message to a fully satisfying conclusion. A satire that's not gonna resonate with everyone...but what satire ever does?
Barbie is pulp and just as well - it never ceases to be enjoyable.
"Director Greta Gerwig achieves the feat of a delivering a big budget Barbie movie with smart and subversive social commentary, all wrapped up in a hot pink cotton candy camp valentine."
Gerwig finds enough laughs to keep anyone from trying to plumb any depths or wonder whether the plot makes any sense at all
"Barbie is a very hip movie with something to say, but the narrative leaves so little room for nuance and interpretation that you walk out with more questions than curiosities."
"In Barbie, Greta Gerwig presents a genuine and candid vision. She dramatizes the anguish of adult life, yet transforms it into a relaxed experience, with moments of comedy and musical interludes. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Gerwig’s Barbie isn’t trying to create a Feminist World Order, she’s merely using a well-known character to exaggerate society’s flaws. The message of this movie really is equality and regaining the balance of power."
"Gerwig’s glee as a director is evident... It’s a lot to take in, and some skits work better than others. But if you consider this movie to be a package deal, the package is wrapped nice and tight -- but not perfectly."
"It’s funny, it’s bright and uplifting, and I think has a lot to say about the modern world – both in terms of feminism and gender equality. Ryan Gosling really goes all-out."
"[Robbie] takes this amorphous idea of the Barbie doll and finds her heart and soul, and makes her a fully realized woman. And I’ll be damned if the guy [Gosling] doesn’t nearly steal the movie from her."
"This production manages to fit in a pop show, absurd comedy, feminist content, parody, and Greta Gerwig's auteurist sensibility. [Full review in Spanish]"
"It is a pop culture phenomenon that has taken over the moment by introducing modern femininity to viewers willing to ditch streaming and head to theaters. It’s campy, introspective, fun, and emotional all in one movie."
The creativity in the script by Gerwig and her husband Noah Baumbach is the highlight and is sure to garner awards consideration in that category.
Just as fun as it looks. Director Greta Gerwig makes the Barbie world really come to life in a way that would have been disastrous in other hands.
"""Barbie"" is confusing! This allegorical farce ultimately affirms the matriarchy, so it logically follows that ""Barbie"" is inherently transphobic. So why are there trans-Barbies? Who the heck knows what Gerwig is trying to say here? It's quite fun though!"
Bright and sparkly but ultimately doesn't satisfy.
"Mostly, Barbie is laugh-out-loud funny and a sheer delight."
"A consistently engaging comedy driven by wacky production design, joyful musical numbers, and goofy and committed performances."
"It would be churlish to deny the charm of Gerwig’s buoyant creation. In an age when genuine cinematic joy is rare, we’re all lucky to be passengers in Barbie’s hot-pink plastic convertible."
"The final cut is a paradox of ideas: superficial yet smart, caustic yet clever, and showcasing not just the very best but even the worst... no doll is left behind... Barbie still has the ability to become whatever girls need her to be..."
"I couldn’t help thinking about how Barbie has already been a big-screen character in Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3, where the filmmakers used her more cleverly than anything that is done here."
"The film is proof that Barbie’s longevity as a cultural icon is a marvelous yet mysteriously resilient thing. Gerwig’s hard-edged but affectionate paean is sweeter than it is satirical, slightly more perky than political."
Barbie was doomed from the start.
"Its patriarchal theme creates the perfect sandbox for a movie like this to play in. It’s the clunky execution, the surface-level storytelling.... and the complete lack of restraint that ultimately weighs the movie down."
Greta Gerwig proves trustworthy in her interpretation and adaptation of reality.  [Full review in Spanish]
"Barbie is an invitation to take uncertainty by the hand, enjoy the vanilla, the ordinary; no longer the brilliance of Barbieland, but the opacity of what we yet don't understand. [Full review in Spanish]"
Give Gosling the Oscar.
"Oh, to have been in the Gerwig/Baumbach house while they wrote this inspired silliness!"
Barbie is a healing cinema experience that explores the psyche of not being enough while delivering an infectious performance that makes us feel like we could do anything.
Greta Gerwig's magnum opus is a brilliantly funny rallying cry for decency and shredding hypocrisies. There's not a laughless minute to be had with Robbie and Gosling nailing every gag and emotion with an equally inspired ensemble.
"Depending on your perspective, Barbie is either anathema to the feminist movement, or a great asset. Somehow, Gerwig and Baumbach have managed to incorporate both views into this film."
Squarely take(s) aim at millennial angst about our place in an ever-changing world that isn't as good as the one we thought we were building.
"Seriously, how did this movie get made? All...hail...Greta Gerwig."
"An existential crisis wrapped in a hot pink bow, Gerwig's Barbie is a hilarious, subversive romp. While it can't address as many issues as the plastic protagonists would posit, it's still forging the way."
For the constraints that I'm sure were in place...I'm pretty impressed.
"Barbie is hilariously meta, containing spectacularly funny musical numbers, and an efficient tonal balance between over-the-top comedy and rich, thought-provoking social commentary."
"Barbie is a phenomenally funny, smart, really engaging film."
"Robbie perfectly embodies Barbie, but Gosling easily steals the spotlight with his hilarious Kenergy. The movie works best when it operates as a deliriously fun fantasy comedy."
"Things end with an attempt to bring Barbie’s origin story full-circle, but the transition is clunky, and it suggests this was just supposed to be a Legally Blonde-style take on the Pinnochio tale all along."
A candy-colored Trojan Horse into the heart of contemporary culture and features superb and layered performances.
"This is absolutely sensational, and anyone who can’t vibe with the sharp, empathetic commentary here has got to grow up. This really is one of the best IP films ever."
"""Barbie"" is well worth seeing on the big screen. This campy mix of genres is a summer blockbuster for a reason and will be a perfect position for both young adults and those who have outgrown playing with dolls but wish to reminisce."
"Gerwig turns in a comedy that lightly approaches topics that, outside the screen, adhere to a higher gravity.  [Full review in Spanish]"
Greta Gerwig manages to reconcile corporate interests with those of her own filmography. [Full review in Spanish]
"Barbie never quite arrives where Gerwig wants it to go. But god, is it fun to watch."
"Greta Gerwig's Barbie delivers on the sweetness, satire, and fun performances of its main cast as Mattel's beloved, yet controversial doll lineup."
"It's attempting to do many things at once, but does most of them well, most of the time."
"The Barbenheimer phenomenon pleases me primarily because it's proof there is room for an unapologetically pink feminist manifesto next to a deadly serious anti-war story in our existing cineplexes, and that plenty of people will indeed see both."
The ribald humor is just clever enough to please older viewers while flying over younger viewers’ heads.
"The worst thing that could've happened is that Barbie would turn out to be a good product... And unfortunately, it is. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Irreverent, superbly acted and beautifully realized, the movie mines the giggles out of Barbie breaking out of the doll’s house."
"Barbie is a movie about Barbie made with the political awareness, consistency, and intelligence of the doll. Perhaps realizing it's in deep water without a swimming lesson..."
"In trying to be comically ahead of the sexism curve, it’s ended up feeling sexist itself."
"Barbie isn't just beautiful pink eye candy. Greta Gerwig delivers an equally funny and compelling story that most will enjoy. While the 3rd act gets muddled tackling several ideas into a neat ending, Margot Robbie & Ryan Gosling make it all worthwhile."
"Their thunderous feminist message is leavened by plenty of sharp gags and, following her acclaimed 2017 film Lady Bird and the wonderful Little Women (2019), Gerwig further burnishes her reputation as a director of terrific flair."
Gerwig thoughtfully and beautifully explores the uniqueness of women; the feminine in its beauty and in all forms and imperfections. We don’t fit in a box – and never will.
"While Gerwig’s deeper meaning is to give everyone a voice, I worry that the average movie-goer won’t see the forest for the trees, and only take the surface-level message to heart."
"Regardless of Mattel’s corporate intentions, Gerwig has crafted a warm, funny and cinematically rich film -- if one whose narrative and political ambitions are far less radical than it would like us to suppose."
"This movie is bold, smart and surprisingly sophisticated. It may look like a silly action adventure, but textured dialog and rapid-fire gags add important layers of meaning that strike a nerve."
Barbie does something more than just highlight the ridiculous and limiting nature of external and internalized misogyny.
Gerwig continues to be wildly bold while delivering masterful work!
"""Barbie"" isn’t the satire some may have been hoping for, fangs dripping with pink blood; it’s a classic Horatian satire, tickling its target on the tummy instead of disemboweling it."
"Greta Gerwig's Barbie is simply delightful. The worldbuilding and set design is incredible, and very nostalgic for those of us who grew up playing with Barbie dolls. Robbie is fantastic, but it is Gosling's Ken that steals the show."
"“That felt achey, but good,” Barbie says when a tear escapes her eye for the first time. The impossibility of perfection gives way to an ache in the soul about existence and its doomed fleetingness. That's the essence of Barbie, the essence of life itself"
"The message is more powerful than what we can see with the naked eye, but we will not be able to see it if we believe this film is... an 'anti-men' film. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The feminist parable doesn’t always make sense and some characters fail to come to life. But, after a raft of over-polished ­blockbusters, this messiness feels ­refreshing"
"Brimming with great gags and vibrant visuals, it’s a dizzying pop o’ culture and universality. Through a smart, clever, and funny script... it is also self-aware and pokes fun at the Barbie ideal and how that has evolved over the years."
"…fun for kids, a mind-blower for thinking adults…"
"The real ideas in the film are enough to make the movie work without the focus on weak men, even though that focus entertains. It brings a weird darkness to the effort because, at core, it’s mean in much the way the film's women feel the world is to them."
"The Barbie movie is thoughtful, funny, and emotional. The dialogue in this movie will have me thinking about it for days to come. Performances, costume, and set design are top-notch."
"Giddily wrapped in a pretty, rosy-colored package, it's a social satire about our society and and gender relations. Gorgeous, uproarious and ingenious, “Barbie” will be remembered as one of the defining pop culture movies for years to come."
"It's a real good time... it was a weird choice for Greta Gerwig, I think, and yet she's done the absolute best you could probably do with a film like this."
"Barbie goes beyond the marketing for an intellectual property. This isn't just a toy commercial, it's smart and entertaining."
"Robbie infuses Barbie with the exuberance and joy we expected from the portrayal. But the descent into actual life issues is a surprise that the audience never suspects is coming. Gerwig’s visualization is a true feat, right down to Barbie's feet."
Protective of the Barbie image and more expansive of it.
"A seriously funny, crazily ambitious movie. But 'Barbie' bites off more than it can chew, and only nibbles the hand that feeds."
"In the hands of [Greta] Gerwig, Barbie is far from superfluous—but it’s also not the calibre of movie that I imagined she would deliver."
"It’s a riotously entertaining candy-coloured feminist fable that manages simultaneously to celebrate, satirise and deconstruct its happy-plastic subject. Audiences will be delighted. Mattel should be ecstatic."
"Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister in charge of the wartime German film industry, believed the most effective use of the medium was to bury the message in ostensibly innocuous genre fare. You sense he’d have found Gerwig’s film a bit much."
"[Director] Gerwig doesn’t just seek to make an entertaining movie, but an important one. And in that regard it succeeds."
"A unique, big budget comedy with auteur sensibilities, that is elevated by talented and committed artists. Very funny, except for when it loses its playfulness to deliver well-intended social commentary in an excessively direct way. [Review in Spanish]"
I have to give props to Gerwig and Baumbach for managing to paint this film with as much pathos as they do pink.
"Barbie is the ultimate summer movie for having as much wit and wisdom as it does charm, silliness, and an abundance of pink."
"Margot Robbie as Barbie is play, joy and fun rolled up into an icon. The script is phenomenal. Costume design make up and hair are extraordinary. Barbie’s dream world on film is what I thought of in my world of play as a girl."
I’ve long believed in the power of Barbie. I’m just glad Gerwig did too.
"A film that presents us with a really interesting story that goes beyond the stereotypes that one might have of these dolls, and that tries to convey valuable messages about social injustices and gender roles. Full review in Spanish."
One has to hand it to Gerwig for offering up the most counterintuitive ouroboros of an IP franchise-starter imaginable.
"Fun, original, and profound, Barbie is a colorful odyssey with great performances, catchy musical numbers, and an incisive social commentary. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Greta Gerwig’s Barbie is a love letter to every little girl who grew up fighting something that feels insurmountable to conquer. It’s a bold, bright exploration of existential crises that seem relentless and the hope for something more."
"Beginning life as a conceptual head-scratcher, Barbie ended up being one of the year’s best surprise gems."
"After a sweet and funny first 20 minutes, the performance of Ryan Gosling (as the ever-clueless Ken) and a grandly overstated, feminist soliloquy by America Ferrera, as a former Barbie mom, become hip highlights of this more silly than clever movie."
"I have never struggled so much with a ""fresh"" or ""rotten"" score. Ultimately, I'm settling on the positive side. Even though Barbie is too long and chalk-full of cringy monologues; the fun cast, wonderful musical numbers and great visuals make up for it."
"The details of the story seem utterly inseparable from, and continuous with, the riotously ornamental visual realms that it sets into motion."
"A delightful confection at its best, an unfocused jumble at its worst."
"The movie revels in the history of Barbie, from the related dolls that didn’t quite take off to the notion that the doll presents both an impossible physical ideal and yet also allowed the children playing with Barbies to imagine endless possibilities."
"The tonal and narrative balance is handled incredibly well throughout, and, whilst it can’t claim to be perfect and certainly won’t appease everyone, I had a blast and my Kenergy levels were satisfied. Life in plastic really is fantastic, clearly."
"If you’re looking for nuance and subtlety - this is not the movie for you. But it’s also so easy to get caught up in this vibrant, exuberant, campy adventure that clearly comes from the heart."
"Gerwig leaves a personal imprint on her film, as a boldly painted battle cry for womanhood and subversive social satire about misguided male perceptions."
Barbie suffers from an over-bloated script that’s trying to tackle too much with too many stars instead of focusing on character development. The marketing was more successful than the movie itself.
"Gerwig has directed a lively, zany, oh-so witty and pretty Barbie flick that's perfectly cast, a costuming showcase and, in Barbie Land, a production-design dream."
"Barbie's middle gets a little soft, but [writers Greta] Gerwig and [Noah] Baumbach ... turn plastic into flesh, tugging at the heartstrings and tickling the funny bone with the year's most vivacious tribute to imaginative play and female empowerment."
"I fully enjoyed it, although I thought it got too preachy by the end."
Barbie recognizes its own surreal existence: a world where perfect plastic figures wrestle with humanistic imperfections.
Clever and funny – but frustratingly shackled by Mattel’s oversight – this film is a cute diversion but wants to be so much more.
"A cinematic dreamland of pastel eye candy and immaculate dialog, with deeply meaningful messages for all."
Gerwig and Robbie are both so into the material that their deconstruction of the cultural icon has resulted in a magnificent film. [Full review in Spanish]
"in Gerwig’s hands, along with her co-writer Noah Baumbach, it’s sly and just about as subversive as a movie can be."
"Barbie hits the target on many levels. It’s a fun, whimsical romp with a great message. Robbie is proving to be the true movie star of our time."
It feels like Barbie will be more enjoyable the more you think back on it. Ryan Gosling is outrageously funny and the film fully embraces ridiculous concepts while also intellectually tickling our brains as we question how we socially treat one another.
"Combining with high-level pop culture and topical gender theory jokes, Gerwig showcases her incredible vision."
"There is no escaping the onslaught of corporations squeezing profit from every “intellectual property” available. Rage all you want, it’s still going to happen, and this is the best version of what it can be."
"Barbie is surprisingly spiritual, treating the messiness and contradictions of womanhood with reverence."
"Barbie’s plastic exterior turns out to be extraordinarily human, turning a doll with unrealistic beauty standards that young girls could never relate to into someone every single woman can relate to."
"Barbie ultimately asks what it means to be mortal, what it means to be alive — and it takes these questions seriously."
"Gerwig and Baumbach somehow make all of these heavy and relevant themes feel accessible and nuanced at the same time. They don’t beat around the bush, as they know that addressing all of this directly while maintaining an air of whimsy will do the job."
"Barbie is clever, indulgent and fun. Greta plays around with the ideas of patriarchy, puberty, feminism and existentialism like they're from her dollhouse."
Gerwig has delivered a summer entertainment that has plenty of brains in its blonde bombshell.
"Barbie is mostly brisk, eye-catching, and entertaining, made with imagination and affection."
"Barbie is one of the most subversive, unexpected summer blockbusters in recent memory."
"Barbie positions itself as subversive, but by the film’s end, it's unclear what the filmmakers have actually managed to disrupt or undermine beyond our perception of the Mattel corporation."
"Instead of offering a reflection of what it means to be a human living alongside other humans, Gerwig falls into a cliched form of existentialism in which life is essentially meaningless, and it’s up to us to assert our own meaning."
"Greta Gerwig's surprisingly sharp and satirical spoof on the toy icon is really a probing look at gender roles circa 2023, with Barbie and Ken as chaste lovers turned antagonists. Feminism can be funny!"
"Throughout, the tone is playfully ironic with a side of preach. The biggest joy is in the endless runway of familiar doll costumes and the cotton candy sets. Robbie makes a genial ringmaster, with a terrific cast."
"A very well-made, fun film with real heart and a wink but perhaps too many smooth areas."
"Barbie is perfect summer fun. It has meaningful moments and wacky fourth wall breaks that immerse you in the film. You dare to believe a Barbieland is a hop, skip, and high-heeled strut away."
"Margot Robbie oozes charm and radiance and pathos every moment of the film. The production design and costuming are sublimely fun, with pink plastic exclamation points marking every visual gaga and every nostalgic callback."
"[Barbie is] two hours of dizzying, occasionally dazzling ideas, squished and squashed and stuck together without any real shape, sense or structure."
"It’s both a flippy romp and a feminist outcry in shades of pastel pink. It’s a movie knowingly at odds with itself, and the disequilibrium, for all the film’s high cheer, sits uneasily on the screen."
"Barbie has a symbiotic view of how play becomes wearyingly, terrifyingly freighted with real-world meaning, which helps explain why the movie’s vision of the real world is somehow both whimsical and jaundiced."
"Under normal circumstances, Barbie would be an overpowered, expensive vanity piece with a threadbare plot and lackluster dialog. Greta Gerwig, with a co-writing credit to Noah Baumbach, infuses real world existential crises into a cotton candy landscape."
"Barbie is 114 minutes of clever, colorful chaos that’s also a sweet, self-referential salute to womanhood -- and the toy that was always there for young girls when they were figuring all that out."
"Who knew that an eleven and half inch tall plastic doll could hold the power to make me laugh, cry, and have deep meaningful thoughts about my overall existence."
Not enough comedy for 2 hours. It's not Barbenheimer. It's Barbie-occhio.
"Much like the titular doll, Gerwig gives us a product that appears perfect but is ultimately hobbled by its unintended contradictions."
"Greta Gerwig does a fantastic job in building different worlds, both in Barbieland and the real world. Margot Robbie is perfectly cast and I enjoyed her character's arc."
"Like its protagonist, Barbie is all the things all at once. Funny. Sentimental. Entertaining. Confrontational. Celebratory. Heartfelt. Heartbreaking. Kooky. Emotional."
"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are absolute standouts, embracing their roles with abandon and passion to create wonderfully relatable flawed characters in pursuit of meaning."
The movie always maintains an unabashed good mood.
"Gerwig's comical societal study and trippy trip fashions several surprises.  The biggest one might be Gosling's hilarious, scene-stealing performance."
"Barbie is very entertaining in the moment, but like the dolls themselves, it feels like a movie that will be forgotten once the novelty wears off."
"Surprisingly mature and thoughtful, as well as deeper and wittier than you ever thought a Barbie movie could go, it’s both an escape and an emotional thesis. I guess it’s true; Barbie really can be everything."
You can feel the pressure to negotiate and justify Barbie's existence for today's audience getting in the way of a good time. If only Margot Robbie had the opportunity to let loose and have as much fun with it as Ryan Gosling and Kate McKinnon did.
"Barbie is one of the year's best films. Margot Robbie's Barbie character arc is beautiful and America Ferrara delivers the most memorable dialogue in the film, I will be seeing this movie multiple times!"
The film may be candy-coated but it’s one barbed entertainment for discriminating adults.
"A triumph of feminist filmmaking and perfecting queer appeal, leading to this being one of the year's best movies."
It manages to come across as both an ingenious pop-culture lampoon/celebration and an unpretentious but surprisingly heartfelt deep dive into the implications of the Barbie archetype.
A deliriously joy-filled social satire.
Director Greta Gerwig takes the eternally popular Mattel doll and uses it to spin a masterful social satire.
"Delving into deeper topics, fleshing out a timely satire, rooting for womanhood while being full of beans, dance, music, charm and comedy, Gerwig's creativity knows no bounds."
"Gerwig shows that you can show off this cornerstone of capitalist meta commentary in technicolour, musical fun, while also exploring themes of girls' confidence, smashing the patriarchy, and finding one's real identity."
"If you don't know much about Barbie, there is still fun to be had, but not nearly as much as for those in the know."
"Robbie is a sunbeam of sweetness and determination, and Gosling, resplendent under blindingly blond hair, is her lovably clueless quasi-boyfriend."
They made a Barbie movie for grown-ups about feminism and the patriarchy. Let that sink in for a moment.
"Even when Greta Gerwig trips on her ambition to make this hot-pink fantasia more than the fun party of summer, you cheer her refusal to play it safe as she turns Robbie’s doubt-plagued Barbie and Gosling’s clueless Ken into a match made in movie heaven."
"The artisanship was Spectacular! The brilliance of Greta Gerwig is on full display. The performance and fun as well as enduring. The films has a thoughtful message on embracing “You” & all the wonderful things that make ""You"" who you are."
"Audiences will be clamoring to embrace their unique versions of Barbie, Kens, or even Allans. Gerwig’s directorial prowess is unmatched. With a perfect score filmography, one can only wonder if her foot is arched beneath her shoe."
Gerwigland is a hectic pastel trip.
"It's a bit busy, and ideas fly around so fast that it's hard for some of them to stick. But it's a funny, sharp movie, and one that addresses themes of womanhood more clearly than any movie I can remember."
"Margot Robbie plays the main character in Barbie, but it’s Latina women—America Ferrera’s Gloria and onscreen daughter Sasha—that tug at the heartstrings the most."
Margot Robbie is perfectly cast in Greta Gerwig’s wacky and wildly imaginative comedy about Mattel’s superstar doll. It’s the kind of movie that the term ‘meta’ was coined for.
"as I think about this colorful confection, I realize that women’s battle for equality – true equality – is an ongoing one that is still a long way from being won."
"Barbie is working so frantically and exhaustingly to justify its own existence that at some point, top-like, it spins 360 degrees right back around to, “Wait, why are we here doing this again?”"
"""It's diving into that imaginative play and you [the audience] are the one that's playing."""
Gerwig’s imaginative and thought-provoking take on the material represents the best-case scenario for a major studio's toy line adaptation.
"Gerwig gives us a feminist ""Barbie"" who's pretty witty, and pretty in pink."
Pretty postmodernism in pink.
"It’s a wild, hilarious, meta ride that will have you nostalgic for childhood in the midst of real-world issues."
"Fabulous looking, superbly acted yet deeply troubling... and brought to you by Mattel. Coincidence?"
"Barbie is entertaining and often hilarious. While the story feels a bit unfocused at times, Gerwig effortlessly creates an authentic world that comes to life in an inventive way. Robbie and Gosling are perfect."
"But if it’s not the uncompromising bastion of feminist cinema we might have wished for, then Barbie still leaves plenty to commend as a laugh-out-loud, amiable, endearingly sincere, and extremely entertaining summer blockbuster..."
"There are more than a few gut-busters that take this bizarre concept and run with it in surprising ways. But for every transcendent piece of humor, there are ten gags that don’t register."
"While there are great laughs and visuals, it's a case of the commentary leading the characters rather than the characters leading the commentary. When you forget the characters the film is supposed to be about are even in the film, there's a problem."
"“Barbie” is “My Barbie Life To Live” and “Two Or Three Things I Know About Barbie” and “Farewell to Language”...  blunt politics about objectification, capitalism and “sexualized capitalism” and patriarchy that would not be out of place in  “La chinoise.”"
"The Kens steal the show with…""I'm Just Ken,"" destined to go down in queer history alongside other classic homoerotic movie musical moments like ""The Aggie Song"" from ""The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas,"" and ""Take Off with Us"" from ""All That Jazz."""
"Barbie might not be an overtly queer film, but at the end of the day, its campy heart owes a whole lot to the dolls."
"Barbie is a fantasy comedy that doesn't take itself seriously for a second, but still has something very serious to say. [Full review in Spanish]"
"While the film is often funny, clever, and insightful, it's also so over-crowded with ideas and subplots that it resorts to simply preaching its message to resolve the story."
Barbie is overblown fun with a feminist twist
"Barbie is a triumph. There’s so much happening in every corner of the frame, yet not so much that Gerwig ever loses focus on the characters populating her madcap realm of nonsensical imagination."
"Bright and colorful on the outside, but a full on journey through self acceptance and discovery on the inside. Whenever I need a good cry, I am going to turn to Barbie."
"[Greta Gerwig] has crafted a film that is at once intelligent, funny, sexy and unexpectedly emotional."
"By the end of Barbie’s 114 minute runtime, which flies by, your face will ache from the laughing and smiling but your heart will hurt from the hurting and raging."
"Barbie works because it balances a myriad of themes, and succeeds – against all odds. It manages to be funny, and irreverent, but also self-deprecating, and profound. At times it’s important, it can be poignant, and it can absolutely downright ridiculous."
Robbie’s uncanny likeness to the original Mattel blueprints for Barbie – along with her sheer likability in front of a camera – generates the right kind of feminised force field from which the film can continually draw power.
Just about everything one could hope — both a critique and celebration of the enduring toy’s role in the lives of young girls over the years and a colorful-and-zany romp that never forgets to entertain.
"If you open up your heart to the weird and wonderful embrace of Greta Gerwig’s transcendent Barbie, you’ll be greeted by an audacious production design, swimming in exquisite film references and tender vulnerability."
"Frantic, uncheerful, and graceless, Barbie symbolizes a culture that devalues childhood and goodness."
Greta Gerwig surprises with a comedy that manifests soul as funny as it is provocative with a looming Ryan Gosling.  [Full review in Spanish]
"There’s of lot of zeitgeist appeasement going on here. But the production values are sensational and there are some excellent jokes, even if Ryan Gosling’s Ken leaves Margot Robbie’s Barbie standing. They should have called this ""Ken."""
"Through using their otherness perspective, Barbie functions as a warning tale that mirrors the struggles of women living under the patriarchy to understand the learned behavior of humanity."
"The neatest trick is how Barbie, starring a pitch-perfect Margot Robbie, can simultaneously and smoothly both mock and admire its source material."
"Robbie spends so much time playing second fiddle to other characters that her emotional payoff ends up leaning on audience nostalgia more than it has any right to. Her Barbie is everything, and nothing at all."
"Between Gloria, Allan, Weird Barbie, and even Robbie's Stereotypical Barbie, the film's designated Pinocchio--she just wants to be a real woman--Gerwig has injected this corporate product with genuine feeling."
"The movie perfectly balances humor and blockbuster drama. It has very moving messages about womanhood, self, and even life and death that will leave you teary, but it also has more than a few moments that will leave you cackling with delight."
Greta Gerwig can really turn anything into gold and give you an existential crisis with it. This time gold came in pink.
"Despite it being radically different from her previous work in form and tone, Barbie has the Gerwig stamp. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Gerwig stuffs the 12-inch box Mattel gave her with ideas, flourishes, and twists until it bursts into a kaleidoscopic rainbow of confetti. The aftermath makes for a bit of a candy-colored mess, but the remnants on the floor are an unmistakable original."
"It's at its best in the beginning and the end, but the movie is undone by a middle section where gags give way to convention that constrains any attempts at subversiveness."
"Is “Barbie” a fun time at the movie theater? Absolutely. Will it make you laugh, and maybe even tear up at points? For sure. Then the filmmakers, and Mattel, did their job."
