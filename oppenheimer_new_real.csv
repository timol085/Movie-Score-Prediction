review;
Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer stands not only as one of the very best films of the year, but also one of the finest accomplishments of his remarkable career.;
An intense, inventively filmed, and well-acted biopicture about the kinds of events that are hard on the heart.;
With pitch-perfect contributions by Nolan’s previous collaborators on the craft team and some newcomers, every inch of every image feels meticulous.;
In a movie about impending global catastrophe, he gives a close-up of a face, and a twitch of a lip the power of an atom bomb.;
Oppenheimer is the most important story of our time.;
What he [Nolan] has put before our eyes definitively deserves to be seen, as does Cillian Murphy's performance in the role of Oppenheimer and the irreconcilable but fantastic Robert Downey Jr. in the role of Lewis Strauss. [Full review in Spanish];
His latest effort is too much of an endurance test, a magnum opus consumed by its quest for significance...;
A cinematographic marvel by all measures. [Full review in Spanish];
The explosion of the test bomb is a bravura dance of imagery and sound, but also lack of sound. It’s an understanding of power without any of the essential characters in that moment knowing precisely what’s to come.;
Oppenheimer is mythic, massive, and a masterful work from Christopher Nolan. Murphy & Downey Jr. deliver career best performances in what is the most important movie of the decade.;
Oppenheimer is a flawed genius who can grapple with the intricacies of quantum mechanics but can’t resolve the moral dilemmas that plague his public and private lives.;
[Christopher Nolan's] most stirring plea to humanity yet. A three-hour drama that plays like a terse thriller, weaving Nolan’s deep-seated fears for the survival of our species through a biography of one of its most significant and controversial figures.;
Armed with a haunting Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan gives us his most personal and political film yet, that is fascinating as it is flawed.;
Oppenheimer is sombre and electrifying, dizzying and bloated, a contradiction that never quite comes together but at the same time is one of Nolan’s best and most political works to date.;
The true test of 'Oppenheimer' is whether Nolan can maintain his typically mammoth vision with a narrative that mostly comprises white men talking in small rooms. Like his protagonist, he succeeds in a grand and unexpectedly horrifying fashion.;
Though the entire ensemble operates as a well-oiled machine, it feels like distracting stunt casting at times.;
A cinematographic masterpiece... of the highest level, as well as an organized sensorial experience that gives us back a historical event that is relevant in the present and also transcendental. [Full review in Spanish];
After three hours of viewing, you will understand Oppenheimer's  drive for success--I can highly recommend the film as you’ll learn a wealth of information while being artfully entertained.;
Oppenheimer is a long film, but it never causes a sense of ennui. The subjects are both intriguing and terrifying as Nolan warns against nuclear possibilities and character assassination.;
It is a noble try, an interesting experience, and an absolutely fascinating example of the director as superstar.;
It is the most exhilarating and harrowing story about scientists I’ve seen in a minute, with a cast of staggering renown bringing the story to life.;
With human paradoxes at its nucleus, this is a riveting portrait, both intimate and epic, of the self-involved men who think they make the world go round... and too often, tragically, do.;
Cillian Murphy did a fantastic job with his portrayal of Dr. Oppenheimer! Not only did he resemble Dr. Oppenheimer, he was able to capture all of the fear and torment with his facial expression alone! Christopher Nolan truly brought filmmaking up a notch!;
"""Oppenheimer"" is a stunner and one more way director Christopher Nolan reminds us cinema is a vital art form, not a disposable one.";
I find the last third of this movie to be interesting, and the first two-thirds to be long and, at times, not understandable.;
It's a huge film, designed to be watched in IMAX (as I did) but it's actually a very intimate tale: arguably the first character study that Nolan has ever done.;
The three-hour running time and scientific jargon demand patience, but Nolan's marriage of visuals and sound design is often dazzling, not least during the tension-filled detonation of the prototype device.;
Thankfully, despite my qualms with Nolan purposefully structuring things to exploit our belief he's finally told a straightforward story, I was still completely taken by its gravitas. Give Murphy and Downey Jr. Oscars.;
The way the director approaches Oppenheimer's fears and his internal struggles with surrealistic images is the most admirable aspect of the film, and leaved us wanting to see more about it. [Full review in Spanish];
OPPENHEIMER is Christopher Nolan's magnum opus. An engrossing epic that brings you inside the tortured mind of a man driven to change the world. Cillian Murphy is quietly stunning as the consumed Oppenheimer and RDJ delivers an Oscar worthy performance.;
This is very clear, effective, disciplined prestige filmmaking, enough to make this one of the toniest pieces of Oscarbait that I expect to see this year - but it is Oscarbait.;
Nolan refrains from passing judgment on Oppenheimer – leaving that to us, if we so choose – suggesting instead that it’s within our inherently contradictory human nature to create as well as destroy.;
The supporting cast are astonishing, particularly Downey Jr, who is on career best form as Strauss – his Best Supporting Actor nomination is surely already in the bag.;
This movie resembles a nightmare that torments not only the protagonist, but all of humanity. A horror that still lives and that finds a perfect representation in Cillian Murphy's haunted eyes. [Full review in Portuguese];
An intellectual thriller that is a masterpiece of image and word, of complex ideas made manifest, and all kept at a very human level to maintain constant immediacy.;
One of the most stirring things about this excellently dense and jumpy biopic is that Nolan never tries to reconcile his subjects’ contradictions. If anything, he realises the futility of trying to know the unknowable. Who was J. Robert Oppenheimer?;
The momentum the film generates due to the chronological cross-cutting becomes relentless, and that runaway feeling is beautifully harmonious with the film’s broader interest in Oppenheimer’s legacy.;
...a technically-impressive yet mostly underwhelming drama...;
As emotional, beautiful, and thought-provoking as this film is, it’s that much more powerful because it’s based on historical events. It’s a film I won’t be able to shake for a long time.;
Rarely have I left a movie feeling smarter than when I went in, but “Oppenheimer” is just such a film and it elevated my thinking, especially in regards to the science of politics and the politics of science.;
The film’s sheer density and a revolving door of characters make it heavy, but more often than not, Nolan’s filmmaking soars.;
The film’s speed – necessary to crunch decades of history into a condensed character study – is a bit like a trick in itself, both neglecting to let us dwell in a moment while emphasizing that Oppenheimer himself rarely did.;
"Nolan and his entire crafts team have made something extraordinary. If the question is can a movie about a historical event be thrilling and suspenseful, Oppenheimer makes the answer a resounding ""yes.""";
A majestic, mournful entertainment that’s as serious as a heart attack, Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan’s bullseye shot at Grand Statement cinema that’s about nothing less than human annihilation.;
This is a big, mammoth movie, boasting a career-best performance from Cillian Murphy, a whip-smart script, and other technical marvels. Jennifer Lame's editing is particularly remarkable.;
Fortunately, it’s not treated like a dense physics course that can be overwhelming and difficult to understand. This film is one of Nolan’s best and searingly simple-yet-complicated works.;
A studious examination of history, shown via a reverent lens of Hollywood spectacle, Oppenheimer is a chilling biopic that could be Christopher Nolan’s best picture yet.;
This is a complex look at a complicated man, but Oppenheimer unequivocally establishes that this is a story worth telling -- and that Nolan was the perfect filmmaker to do it.;
If Dunkirk, [Christopher Nolan's] 2017 film about the historic World War II battle, was his bid to prove that he’s a “serious filmmaker”, then Oppenheimer proves that he should be considered one of the modern masters of cinema.;
Every scene feels like a cataclysm waiting to happen, fitting for a film that builds, step-by-step, to the creation of a cataclysm machine. Oppenheimer both summons awe for what it took to build the bomb and for the changes it wrought.;
A messy, sprawling, operatic statement from Nolan. It’s technically masterful, but can also keep you at a distance during crucial moments. But it’s also incredibly exciting to behold, a mosaic of intellectual cinema drenched onto the screen.;
On one side it’s an opportunity to get a history lesson on the matter, but the film only really shines on a few scattered powerful moments. It all came up more informative than fun.;
In a year that has given us several great films, this one shines above the rest and is the strongest contender for the Oscar so far in 2023.;
As he corrals the world’s scientists to follow behind him Robert Oppenheimer is magnetic, more akin to a cult leader than a lowly whitecoat.;
At three hours, Oppenheimer as a whole falls short of the sum of its pleasing parts.;
There’s one element worthy of unreserved praise here, and that’s Robert Downey Jr.’s welcome-home performance — his comeback, if you will, from his comeback, which kidnapped him into Marvel movies for eleven years;
So much of our lives is about the fear and fearlessness around turning theory into action, at all levels of our lives. Oppenheimer is a run with those bulls, fearless and relentless.;
Despite a few minor problems, Nolan has shown that with great patience comes great power. It may take some time but eventually Nolan shows his latest work is a blinding light of creativity.;
Oppenheimer is on the cusp of changing the world, mostly for the worst, but barely focuses on the moral quandary of this. All the Nolan beats but were missing the snarky Sorkin dialogue of A Few Good Men and smooth Tarantino style of Inglourious Basterds.;
[Nolan] captures that theoretical aspect of Oppenheimer on the screen in very personal moments... that energy, that swirl of passion in the unknown it's all there, and it is phenomenal to watch.;
If it does nothing else, this movie reminds us that the world still sits on the brink of global thermonuclear war, and international political and military leaders have repeatedly demonstrated they are no wiser today than world leaders were 78 years ago.;
Oppenheimer leaves you in tatters as it is a gripping piece on a man consumed by guilt and inner turmoil. “A man who became death, the destroyer of worlds.” You won't forget this film for a long time.;
This film is a White-Jewish male compartmentalized view of history that blinds us to the truth of the world that J. Robert Oppenheimer worked in.;
Christopher Nolan’s epic film bio/thriller is so gripping that you feel like you’re right there with Oppenheimer, anticipating the possible horrors his creation might unleash – never mind the horrors it did unleash.;
I am Nolan, saviour of cinema. Look upon my works, ye audiences, and despair. For what it is, it works, but it’s so boring when a man can demand so much to facilitate his achievement and still think he did it alone.;
The easy part for Christopher Nolan was making Oppenheimer a big-screen behemoth...trickier was embedding within that blockbuster a film of almost excruciating intimacy; a psychodrama that probes the soul of the 20th century’s most unknowable man.
'Oppenheimer' is a masterpiece.;
The narrative of Oppenheimer's life certainly holds more than ample fascination for even a film with a three-hour runtime, and the story is treated comprehensively, with care and depth.;
Intellectually engaging, visually and sonically stimulating, and packing an emotional wallop.;
Christopher Nolan’s newest film is jarring and memorable, an ode to creation and consequence.;
Oppenheimer ignores the darker sides of the life and work of J. Robert Oppenheimer in order to deliver a crowd-pleasing, blockbuster spectacle.;
Fascinating and frustrating, too close and aloof, this anti-biopic is a winning fusion of explosive paradoxes.;
Not only does Oppenheimer prove to be one the best-crafted biopics in recent memory, but it also boldly reaffirms the director’s auteur status.;
Everything about Christopher Nolan’s latest movie is massive. The level of shock and awe is breathtaking, but it can also be taxing.;
The paradoxical thrill of Oppenheimer is that Nolan crafts an epic tale that’s intimate in nature—daring to go small when everyone is expecting a grand display of showmanship.;
Oppenheimer should have been called Oppie. And the shorting of the film's name should have been accompanied by an equally dramatic shorting of the film itself.;
A rare film that deserves its hype, Oppenheimer stands tall as a biopic that presents complex and conflicting matters in a clearly understandable manner.;
I was compelled throughout.;
Employing the stark angles of star Cillian Murphy’s expressive mien to great effect, Nolan gets into the head of the physicist, husband, father, womanizer, de facto politician, national hero, accused spy, and bomb-builder whose work changed the world.;
The visuals and technical aspects of Oppenheimer were always going to inspire praise, but it's Nolan's look at our frailty that sets this film in the upper echelon of an already famed filmography.;
Nolan’s name comes with a level of prestige, and he doesn’t disappoint. The sound, score, cinematography, acting and overall execution are immaculate.;
Befitting his paradigm-shattering protagonist, Nolan so audaciously merges form and content that he completely upends the ‘great-man’ biopic.;
It's the film Christopher Nolan was born to direct.;
“Oppenheimer” is sensationally filmed. The performances are mostly great, provided the role is a dude. It is easy to see why so many people are praising what’s here. But it is stealth stupid. It is sneaky simplistic. It is camouflaged dumb.;
Admittedly complicated and confusing, Christopher Nolan's non-linear bio-pic is intense, exacting and explosive. Expect Oscar nods for Nolan, Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr., who deliver the most indelible performances of their respective careers.;
Oppenheimer is a serious and appropriately disturbing film about nuclear weapons and nuclear war. It is intended to leave viewers shaken, and it succeeds in that.;
OPPENHEIMER is Christopher Nolan at his most operatic, his most ethereal, and his most horrific.;
An absolute achievement in spectacle and Swiss-watch storytelling.;
Oppenheimer is about genius, about a man, about a bomb, but it’s also about the waste laid to the world by weak men.;
You may know the story of the “Father of the Atomic Bomb” but experiencing his life and work through Nolan’s lens is a thrilling, captivating treat.;
A directing high-point for the already acclaimed Christopher Nolan. Top-notch performances and a truly riveting tale of what is unfortunately our history. Not a very rewatchable movie and I really wish I would cease to have audio issues with Nolan films.;
Played with unwavering solidity by Cillian Murphy...;
Starring Cillian Murphy, and his cheekbones, the film is dense, ambitious, complex, so very long (three hours) and impressive, even if it does drag by the end.;
Like J. Robert Oppenheimer, Nolan is a genius -- and, also like Oppenheimer, he may be too close to his subject matter to realize that he lost the thread.;
Good acting, good story but sluggish presentation.;
"As dazzling as Christopher Nolan's filmmaking style often is, he still can't escape the trappings of the historical biopic with his three-hour epic, an overstuffed and often overwhelming account of the man known as the ""father of the atomic bomb.""";
"Holding it all together is Murphy... He understands his character’s contradictions; more importantly, he has an uncanny instinct for how to reveal them.";
Cillian Murphy sets the screen ablaze, with a ferocious and intimate performance, and his face is a gateway into another reality. It’s perhaps the single greatest performance in any Nolan film, and a testament to Murphy’s devotion to his craft.;
Oppenheimer deftly illuminates the allure and dangers of being caught in the sweep of history.;
Murphy’s central performance is extraordinary, his angularity embodying the either-or binary of Oppenheimer’s thought processes.;
Nolan’s film is an intense, enlightening character study of a complicated and tormented individual keenly aware that his work is both imminently necessary and potentially cataclysmic.;
Nolan’s ability to create such sharp tension and suspense in a film that’s mostly characters in various rooms talking is quite an achievement.;
Just as epic as you might think. Really brings the historical events to life and gives us a lot to think about coupled with a great excuse to go to the movies.;
Thanks to Nolan and Murphy, we see the full Oppenheimer -- neither monster nor savior, victim nor villain, but in the end, just a man.;
It's a huge historical story to tell and the fact there is still such intimacy to this film just shows the class of it.;
I found Nolan’s pull-out-all-the-stops IMAX extravaganza an exhilarating reintroduction to cinema, stunningly realized by the sweeping cinematography of the Dutch-Swedish Hoyte van Hoytema.;
[Oppenheimer] submerges you in the violence of a guilt-ravaged soul, leaving you feeling unsettled and unclean. Confronting the film’s moral and spiritual weight is a fearsome challenge, and one well worth rising to.;
This is a very heady, brainy spectacle. A thesis. A portrait of a genius, his triumphs and shame.;
The movie is as sluggish as if Nolan were underlining the script’s most salient passages onscreen...;
Nolan has taken a massively complex story in telling Oppenheimer’s life and has made the science accessible and important in terms of its history while weaving in its connection to today.;
The real tribute to Christopher Nolan's talent is how each role, no matter how brief or extensive, is interpreted by an actor who devotes one-hundred percent of their talent to it. [Full review in Spanish];
A master of compressing and collapsing time, Nolan manages to make a three-hour story feel like a sprint instead of a marathon.;
Filmed almost entirely without digital augmentation, Nolan’s FX and sound design teams achieve here a rush of beauty and terror that is unforgettable. Find the biggest screen near you and see for yourself.;
A film energized by the life-and-death consequences the scientist deals with every day for years, [it's] a bracing argument in favor of anti-war activism that paradoxically uses the bomb’s awesome firestorm as a spectacularly ironic punctuation mark.;
Nolan throws down the reality of power, war, and distrust and indirectly relates to our current times of change.;
Expertly marries dialogue-driven action and Nolan's trademark epic spectacle.;
Astonishingly, Nolan’s skills keep getting better with time. Oppenheimer is the best-case scenario for historic filmmaking, blockbuster movies, and the medium.;
Murphy has the eyes of a terrified god.;
One can almost imagine Nolan staring in awe at the final cut of The Dark Knight, and having a vision of the future, like Oppenheimer did of a world engulfed in flames. In his vision, he’s whispering, “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”;
Oppenheimer is the rare summer blockbuster that demands our active engagement, not our simple-minded acquiescence.;
Dear Academy: Please consider Matt Damon’s compelling supporting performance during awards season.;
Christopher Nolan has created a propulsive history lesson that informs upon the ego of man in their quest to create and to hold onto power through both a cinematic timeline and the one we are living through doomed to repeat history for not studying it.;
Cillian Murphy delivers a powerfully acted, believable, and compassionate performance as the real-life scientist who must grapple with the reality of what he has brought to the world.;
It's good but, come on, this is not an IMAX movie. You should not be deprived the chance to see Tom Cruise jumping a motorcycle off a cliff in IMAX in order to see Oppenheimer getting grilled about his security clearance in IMAX. Hardly anything explodes!;
"Oppenheimer is a refreshing outlier, stunning if severely imperfect; and, ironically enough for its subject matter and bleak outlook, a glimmer of hope.";
The subject matter is compelling. The cinematography is fantastic. And the sound editing is spectacular.;
Oppenheimer is a true masterclass in how to build extreme tension and suspense through fast, detailed dialogue, an insanely powerful sound production, and an equally explosive score from Ludwig Göransson.;
Nolan's screenplay jumps through time, slowly revealing his characters and their motivations, only making complete sense in its final moments, but with not a moment wasted.;
You can practically smell the friction between Nolan’s ambition and the familiar biopic rulebook: the life boiled down to illustrative vignettes, the timeline hopscotch, the parachuting in of actors impersonating real people for two or three scenes.;
Nolan’s film takes apart the truly monumental nature of what Oppenheimer’s international team of scientists faced.;
…an uncommonly literate and effective historical drama…;
This is an urgent, blistering work of fire-and-brimstone, as relentless and awing as anything Christopher Nolan has made in his career.;
Oppenheimer is Nolan, Nolan, and more Nolan. [Full review in Spanish];
This is a powerful story of science and war, human achievement and human destructiveness, but it is the human relationships, betrayals, losses and loyalties that make the film come alive.;
In the following decades, it will likely live on as a great work. However, it is not a daring feat of filmmaking. Instead, it is a technically brilliant but ultimately predictable biopic of another great man.;
A grown-up blockbuster about the power of thought. When math hieroglyphs manifest tangibly as a beyond-deadly atomic bomb capable of incinerating 199,000 humans, it would appear that somewhere along the line, the divine was cast out.;
Visually and auditorily, Oppenheimer stands alone, but it’s particularly haunting when the film is finally allowed to be silent. All that’s left is Oppenheimer’s unsteady breathing when everyone realizes what they have unleashed upon the world.;
Oppenheimer is a film whose themes are still true and current: the chain reaction does not end, and the horror of a global nuclear conflict is still latent. [Full review in Spanish];
One thing spectators can take away from Oppenehimer's three hours is the appreciation for Cillian Murphy, who offers the best role of his career. [Full review in Spanish];
With Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan's sprawling biopic delivers thanks to its impeccable performances, direction, and haunting spectacle.;
Oppenheimer is the kind of movie that hardly exists anymore on this scale: serious, adult, and with something to say. [Full review in Spanish];
It’s a film in which 90 percent of the scenes consist of men in suits talking to each other, but Nolan finds a way to make it riveting;
[Nolan's films are] very loud, very busy, and very cold. He's Kubrick on steroids. Oppenheimer is all of those things, but Cillian Murphy's performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer is so riveting I could almost feel some emotion while watching it.;
The left is gonna love this unnecessarily nonlinear film so it will probably be the subject of breathlessly adulatory reviews and up for multitudes of awards, but I found it slow, disjointed, manipulative, and more predispositional than objective.;
Cillian Murphy's performance is accordingly incomplete. Murphy is excellent in portraying Oppenheimer's nervous energy, ambivalence, and self-doubt;
I want Oppenheimer to succeed, because its ambitious and epically-scaled mediocrity is still preferable to the too-many-cooks algorithmic disasters dominating the marketplace.;
Oppenheimer is a film of towering brilliance and fearsome power. It focuses on a man who met the moment, and the same man may have doomed us all.;
Nolan is a director possessed, and Oppenheimer almost radioactive in its effect: it mushrooms in your head long after the film has slipped from the screen, reminding us that it’s not great men that make for great films — it’s the sinners.;
This is a film with intelligence, purpose and historic value.;
Christopher Nolan reinvents how to approach a biopic. A 3-hour-long dialogue-driven film has never felt so suspenseful. Phenomenal cast, with a chilling ending that will stick with you for days.;
Oppenheimer unfolds like a thriller, while not swerving profound questions about the morality of laying Hiroshima and Nagasaki to nuclear waste.;
There are breathtaking visual sequences indelibly enhanced by sound designer Randy Torres which should make this a required theatrical screening. And yet, there are the usual problems which tend to nag at the periphery of Nolan’s ventures.;
Nolan’s script is a powerful reminder to learn from history, with its significant scale and relevance. A film for the moment and for history, Oppenheimer is grade-A cinema and an absolute triumph not to be missed.;
A fascinating and accomplished cinematic object, but as a study of greatness, Oppenheimer’s subject is often obscured by its author’s auteurist preoccupations.;
Complete with inventive structure, layered characters and glorious 70mm imagery. It also has a witty, deeply personal and sharply pointed script that gives a first-rate ensemble cast plenty to work with.;
Absolutely one of the best ensembles of the year!;
A masterstroke from Christopher Nolan who devises an intricate, engrossing and important drama...;
Though many moments undeniably resonate, Oppenheimer is so tightly packed, we cannot get close - ironically kept at almost too safe a distance from the emotional detonations Nolan has worked so hard to create.;
While I did enjoy Oppenheimer overall, I can’t say I’d ever want to watch this movie again.;
It’s a movie like no other, dragging us into the collective guilt of history.;
Murphy executes with brilliance the complexities of Julius Robert Oppenheimer. It’s in his eyes and his voice. Featuring an all-star cast, the biopic moves at a breakneck speed. It’s fascinating and should come with an honorary degree in quantum physics.;
The world forever changed after the atomic bomb. The world of cinema after Oppenheimer remains fundamentally the same. [Full review in Spanish];
Oppenheimer proves to be a perceptive and intelligent film, a sobering reminder of old catastrophes often anticipated. [Full review in Spanish];
Eye-popping cinematography conveys the terrible force of Oppenheimer’s bomb, and brilliant writing invites us to chew over the morality and consequences of its creation.;
This could be Nolan’s finest masterpiece yet.;
This historical biopic about the father of the atomic bomb raises moral and ethical questions that are poignant, chilling, and relevant.;
A film that deals with the obsessions that have been tormenting Nolan for a long time, but also an unusual biopic, more interested in the consequences of its protagonist's actions, than a detailed exploration of his motivations. Full review in Spanish.;
Through powerful performances, filmmakers at the top of their game, and well-timed greater ethical conversations, Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer has not only become the film to beat this year but of many years to come.;
Oppenheimer is worthy of a Best Picture nomination. I definitely felt the runtime, though. I think the film would have been a masterpiece at 1 hour and 45 minutes.;
Nolan's latest work arriving at a time when fear of nuclear destruction is at the highest level since the Cold War feels as poignant and darkly poetic as the work itself.;
A nearly perfect three hour stretch of the world of political bureaucracy played out with the story of Oppenheimer. The film only falls short in what it promised to deliver from the trailers.;
Our poet laureate of logistics, Nolan remains an irrepressible showman.;
Christopher Nolan conquers the biopic with equal parts of shock and awe. [Full Review in Spanish];
After all the memes and hype, Oppenheimer proves to be the real deal. A film that will be remembered and discussed long after its cinema run, Christopher Nolan’s 12th film proves the filmmaker has no intention of slowing down.;
This is an old-school movie designed to make you think, and it succeeds, to the frustration of those who already suffer from insomnia and existential dread.;
For the most part, the film is a towering achievement.;
Oppenheimer will stand amongst Nolan’s greatest achievements - a powerful and profound film that looks beyond the bomb and at the man behind it...ultimately one of the most important people to ever walk the Earth.;
Like a British Prometheus, Christopher Nolan uses the incandescent power of cinema to illuminate a story and figure of colossal magnitudes that incites more admiration than passion. [Full Review in Spanish];
A grounded, emotional biopic in which Nolan employs his calculated pyrotechnics to examine, at a heart-pounding pace, Oppenheimer's triumphs and tragedies like the countdown of a time bomb that is about to explode. [Full review in Spanish];
A majestic, haunting, thought-provoking piece of cinema with a mesmerizing performance by Cillian Murphy. He’ll be the one to beat come award season.;
Complicated by its incredible fidelity to historical fact, slightly hurt by an overabundance of stars and triumphant in its performances, Oppenheimer is an extraordinary movie both because of and in spite of its morose complexity.;
The long-anticipated film meant to be seen and experienced in theaters is an explosive character study on all fronts, strengthened by a stimulating vision and an astounding, unmatched cast.;
Cillian Murphy delivers a sensational performance in this cinematic epic that explores the obsession with legacies and the social responsibility of science. [Full Review in Spanish];
A devastating examination of the vast gulf between science and empathy…;
The horrors [of Oppenheimer] loom large, weighing on everyone and everything it touches, making it a terrifying yet essential film by a director who masterfully encapsulates this deeply thoughtful, chaos-imbued cinematic perfection.;
Sporting an incredible vision and one of the most fascinating casts in recent history, Nolan delivers what is a staggering cinematic achievement.;
The project rocks with great actors and recognizable faces, portraying famously brilliant scientists, spouting magnitudes of historical perspective, and a last act that mixes vile McCarthyism with America's overwhelming fixations on heroism and winning.;
Oppenheimer is, without hyperbole, Nolan’s masterpiece...[it] practically redefines the epic.;
Unsurprisingly, it's brilliant.;
"... scientific and historical accuracy are key. Fortunately for fans of both, ""Oppenheimer"" delivers in telling the truth about the story of the Manhattan Project, at least as much as can be expected of a Hollywood blockbuster.";
Led by a towering (and career-best) performance by Cillian Murphy, Oppenheimer stands tall as Christopher Nolan’s most terrifying yet beautiful work.;
Nolan has not only crafted one of the best films of year. He has made one that will be watched and discussed long after much of its competition has long been forgotten.;
Part thriller and part character study, Christopher Nolan’s biopic of the father of the atomic bomb is his most political movie yet.;
The Trinity Test sequence, which is undeniably impressive to witness on the biggest screen possible, is where I found myself engaging with the hugely inconsistent spectacle filled with questionable dialogue and Michael Bay-adjacent editing.;
Director Christopher Nolan is firing at all cylinders with an all-star super cast delivering some of the best performances in his filmography!;
Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is a surprisingly nuanced examination of ethics, values, ego, scientific exploration, the price and consequences of speaking truth to power.;
Christopher Nolan's crowning achievement. One of the best films I've ever seen on the big screen. At three hours, it does so much and at such an impeccable level, that it results in one of the most immersive, epic biopics ever. [Full review in Spanish];
Murphy is spectacular, and has never been better as Nolan stares so intimately and contemplatively at his revealing face. How joyous it is to see Downey Jr, also never better, actually act again.;
Very impressive, and I want to say that the three hours whip right by.;
"If nothing else, Oppenheimer confirms Nolan's status as the ultimate ""chalkboard director."" He inevitably gives us scenes in which someone flips over a chalkboard to dumb down complex ideas for their fellow geniuses onscreen and us idiots in the audience.";
Bloated and overblown, Nolan shows little respect and understanding of actual science while he builds a convoluted narrative.;
For a movie about the atomic bomb, the quiet stillness of Nolan’s 'Oppenheimer' is the most haunting.;
Oppenheimer’s story is a complicated one, and I’m still not entirely certain that Nolan was the best person to tell it. Though still fettered by some of his usual issues, he creates what is almost certainly his best work in Oppenheimer.;
Nolan has a happy habit of outdoing Nolan. [Full review in Spanish];
Nolan’s Oppenheimer barely qualifies as a biopic... Instead it’s a movie investigating the nature of power: how it is created, how it is kept in balance, and how it leads people into murky quandaries that refuse simplistic answers.;
This is stunning work from Murphy who captures Oppenheimer’s flaws, his mannerisms and his determination in exceptional fashion. It’s a memorable performance in a film that audiences won’t soon forget.;
Because Nolan’s politics are always obscure, it’s good that his filmmaking is so slick, yet laborious, convoluted, and enervating. Otherwise, a perverse amoral epic like Oppenheimer might be dangerous.;
This is a story for all times, but it’s also an especially interesting one at this present time.;
It's the delivery that leaves me a little cold, a little dizzy but not fun-dizzy. The twists that make a film like Interstellar so powerful simply don't work in a true story quite as effectively.;
Christopher Nolan’s blockbuster captures the scientific triumphs and monstrous sins of the Manhattan Project.;
If Greta Gerwig can manage to make a plastic doll feel human, why can't Nolan do the same for the father of the atomic bomb?;
"""Oppenheimer"" is weighty, it's tragic, it's art. Dammit, this is everything cinema should be.";
Both a technical marvel and a hell of a sociopolitical bio-drama, Oppenheimer is indeed a major Nolan banger.;
Oppenheimer lands as one of Nolan’s finest works, and might even be his magnum opus given enough time.;
Christopher Nolan’s least accessible and bravest film to date.;
I can’t in good conscience recommend this to anyone residing in India. If you live in some other country where the certification board doesn’t consider itself to be the censor board, please go and watch it.;
Nolan, typically a master of suspense, grips with a film that is about great minds put at the service of immense destruction. The story told in these frames is about a life lived but also about the consequences still hovering over us today.;
The amount of risks centering around a crucial turning point in history should be infinitely compelling when crafted with off-the-scale production efforts. Somewhere, outside of flickers, a fiery human heart is absent from all the artificial explosives.;
The movie is an incredible achievement, and might be one of the most thorough, ambitious historical dramas ever put to film.;
Not since The Master, perhaps, has a filmmaker used the large gauge to such intimate effect, making a vast canvas from one man’s troubled features.;
Nolan discards the dates and details of traditional biopic storytelling, which is a frustrating if evocative choice. He thrusts us headlong and simultaneously into the advent and fallout of the nuclear arms race with [a] nagging insistence;
Monumental and impressive...but somewhat confusing for people who may not be familiar with the history.;
Christopher Nolan's huge, sprawling, time-shifting epic with dozens of named characters and chronologically scattered storylines. It's amazing, and overwhelming. It's the sort of movie that actually requires multiple viewings to digest it all.;
Part western and part political thriller, Oppenheimer is the kind of major film that only comes around every few years.;
By the film's final moments it has, often by sheer force rather than any kind of elegance, cemented itself as an enormous, ugly-beautiful object infused with as much melancholy as bombast.;
The scene in which state officials decide on which two cities to bomb -- the first to show that they have the ability to do so, the second to demonstrate that they can do it again -- is where Nolan’s blunt, naïve style works best.;
