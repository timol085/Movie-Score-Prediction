review
"In spite of the bloat, there are some decent scares, and Hader almost makes Chapter Two watching on his own."
"It doesn't really hold together as a movie, but if you're invested in It, you'll probably dig It Chapter Two, even though it's really long and a bit of a slog in places."
"Fans of the book should be pleased as it captures the emotional weight, horror, and the terror of childhood trauma and how it manifests into adulthood."
"As the ballyhooed wrap-up to a collective five-hour epic, It: Chapter Two feels rushed in a way that's frankly perplexing given how much time is spent on the slow burn for the first two thirds."
"There are a great many moments and sequences scattered across ""It Chapter Two."" On the other hand, audiences might take issue with there being so many."
...a complete and total trainwreck of a motion picture...
Chapter Two struggles to maintain a taut narrative and its scares end up feeling repetitive.
"It: Chapter Two fails to treat trauma with any nuance or care, leaving its victimized characters high and dry."
"If perhaps it isn't nearly as daring as King's novel, capturing the tone and emotional essence goes a long way towards making this study on fear and trembling effectively entertaining."
"A unique entry in horror movie canon, due to its depiction of love and loyalty as the ultimate weapon against the monster of hate and fear."
"They did an awesome job, pairing these two movies together. The character development was really good over time. It was a little long, though..."
"A great companion piece to the first one. At the end of the day, this can be broken down to a whole long mini-series."
The second chapter fails again. The TV adaptation didn't work. Now it fails to do so with unnecessary flashbacks and a dependence on visual effects. [Full review in Spanish].
"For all its rough edges, IT: Chapter Two is largely rewarding."
"has enough going for it that it doesn't quite feel like a disappointment, but neither does it fully recreate the first film's gripping action and rich emotional texture"
It Chapter Two is never cutesy or self-congratulatory; its relentless pace gives way to a surprisingly moving finale and a real sense of loss.
Trimming the adults' often soppy individual narratives to focus on their more interesting dynamic as a group might have mitigated some of the numbness that sets in from predictability.
It's about self-empowerment rising to defeat the self-doubt and self-loathing spawned from vicious external sources that were often supposed to be their protectors.
"An epic on the scale of modern comic book movies, It Chapter Two is a big deal for the horror genre. While not flawless, there's just so much to love being back with the Losers and Pennywise"
"IT Chapter Two has a lot going on in it- maybe too much. Pennywise is still pretty creepy, and there is compelling emotional depth, but the movie would have benefited from being 20 to 30 minutes shorter."
"For the most part, it's time well-spent in the company of both the adult ensemble and their younger counterparts."
It delivers on what a lot of people want from a sequel like this.
"Maybe if they had cut it shorter? I don't know...if you're a huge fan of the original or the first one, I completely understand, but come on, man, when you're not telling a story and it's three hours, that's not good writing."
IT Chapter Two may be a little drawn out (to a certain degree) but is a very fitting end to what has become one of the most polarizing horror franchises in recent history.
"The film is impeccably cast and the scale is massive. However, because of a far too repetitious middle act, it doesn't fully live up to the original."
"Even with its all-star cast and strong performances, It Chapter Two never quite lives up to its predecessor."
"IT Chapter Two is a bigger, bolder and more chilling outing that delves much deeper into the horror aspects of the source material."
"Laden with underwhelming effects, a half-baked script, and surprisingly flat performances (Save Messrs. Hader and Ransone), IT: CHAPTER 2's too-long sequel fails to deliver any of the first film's surreal, genuinely creepy, under-the-skin scares"
"An epic-length but novella-deep exercise in mild, jokey horror."
It's a mess.
"When you've seen one toothy, slobbering demon, you've seen 'em all -- the fact that one has spider legs while another sports saggy breasts while yet another has a generous Gene-Simmons-in-KISS tongue ultimately doesn't make any difference."
"Although not as strong as first film, IT Chapter Two will devour you through fear, nostalgia and emotional connection."
I enjoyed the cast of the grown-up Losers Club.
"Every cast member here is in full-throttle, and the whole package feels made with a bursting heart and great love for the Losers of Derry."
"While it just falls short of the heights of the first film, this sequel manages to spin a record amount of plates in a china shop without breaking anything."
Basically a three hour version of the first film but the only change is the characters are adults and less charming. Not really worth a sequel.
It Chapter Two is literally a joke. [Full Review in Spanish]
"A film that ends with a whimper more than a bang. Fortunately, there is enough here for fans of the previous film and the book to appreciate."
"There's a sense of rushed, dutiful, and often uninspired box-checking that saps the film's purportedly phantasmagorical sequences of their potency."
"[It Chapter Two's] entertaining and proper creepy throughout, but it would've been nice if it had taken time to slow down here and there."
"It's designed to feel like a rancid reunion, a painstaking re-creation to conjure the same chills it elicited the first time you went to Derry, Maine."
"It Chapter Two is still entertaining - though, at nearly three hours, it sometimes wears out its welcome."
Chapter 2 can only be described as too messy until it gets too organized and then goes back to the worst mess I can imagine.
What should feel like a slowly gathering evil that one cannot forestall arrives with the inevitability of a mandatory sequel.
"I'm sorry to report that these adult Losers never really come together, despite great turns by Hader and a scene-stealing James Ransone as Eddie."
"may not be as frightening or fresh as its predecessor, but overall it is a satisfying conclusion to the chilling story."
"Pennywise is back for more thrills and spills - but at nearly three hours, his reign of terror begins to take a toll."
"Along with Chapter One, this is a finely crafted horror duology that will stand the test of time among the better Stephen King adaptations."
"Well Steve... the good news is; now that you tried, a miniseries tried and a movie tried, it's pretty clear: It wasn't just you - NO ONE can figure out a good ending for this one."
"Went to ""It 2"" wanting to be scared silly. They left out the scared and went for the silly. Too much time clowning around and not with THE CLOWN."
"As these set-pieces could be put in any order, the film feels more like a series of randomly assembled shorts than a coherent feature film."
"I felt sorry for these actors, except for Hader, who emerges unscathed by injecting some badly needed comic relief."
"This second part is simply far less captivating, is in no rush to get anywhere, takes an incredibly long time to get to the point, and ultimately doesn't really do much of anything on its way there."
"IT is not great, but it is good. The actors are strong, there are a couple of excellent Pennywise-child scenes that make the blood run cold. It is also irregularly paced and not every character gets their due. It is a mixed bag, but a recommended one."
"It 2 is about how everything is terrible, but there's hope strong enough to fight it if we believe in our friends. And if they believe in us."
"As a studio horror film sequel it's pretty good, but it's a let-down as a sequel to 'It Chapter One.'"
"The film as a whole is somewhat of a slog, but Skarsgård's Pennywise is such an enigma that I can't help but want more."
"Clearly, Muschietti had a long list of things he wanted to do and tackle in It Chapter Two - and he did all of it. Unfortunately, the movie didn't need most of it."
"I wasn't wowed by the big finale but with a stronger cast and some well-choreographed set pieces, It Chapter Two improves on its predecessor."
As good a sequel as we ever could have hoped after the heights reached by its predecessor
"There's a grandness to its scale and production values that still makes It Chapter Two an enjoyable romp, but it's not the ghoulish scarefest it could be."
"I am confounded how ""It"" built so brilliantly on anticipation and fear, but the sequel opts to rely on so many cheap jump scares and telegraphed moments."
"Not unlike the town in which it's set, Muschietti's It only sees what it wants to."
"It Chapter Two is a perfectly functional companion piece. Both are tied together by an exceptional evil clown performance, and both films feature great ensemble casts and fun scares."
"It Chapter Two offers a fascinating perspective on fear, memory, the shifting dynamics of power over your childhood trauma and what it means to make someone feel small."
"In a Hollywood industry that keeps hitting a home run with each attempt at horror, It Chapter Two is not only another solid entry, but a fitting end to the franchise."
There are plenty of sequences in which you will find yourself holding your breath - and the visual effects department has a ball.
"Director Muscietti maintains an effective, grimy small-town look for Derry, and mostly handles scares deftly."
A rocky horror show indeed.
"It's satisfying, but I think a lot of people are probably going to find it a letdown because it doesn't really punch you up in the same way [as its predecessor]."
"Andy Muschietti has assembled a terrific cast to battle Pennywise in the present day but a muddled and meandering plot bogs the follow-up down and stops It: Chapter 2 from being the essential, epic conclusion fans hoped for."
"It: Chapter Two is a mixed bag that the actors manage to really sell and because of them, the movie is a stressful, fun experience for the most part."
In the end it's a decent experience that stays afloat thanks to a committed cast that has undeniable chemistry. [Full review in Spanish]
The production is spectacular. [Full review in Spanish]
"A wonderful return to King's tale, one filled with jump out of your seat scares, heartbreaking drama, and yet another excellent turn from Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise."
"Sadly, though afforded double the budget, It Chapter Two provides half of the scares of the first installment. This clown's makeup is wearing off, fast."
"If creepy visuals is your thing, then the second installment of Stephen King's popular horror yarn will have you crawling into your seat. But if you require a little tension and unpredictability to get the job done, you should look elsewhere."
"Some quirks here, some added observations there, some action around the corner, and you have what is a somewhat enjoyable if potentially disappointing popcorn-muncher."
Pennywise is so frightening that the kid sitting in front of me was crying and begging her guardian to take her home.
"Chapter Two finds itself stumbling into myriad plot holes or, worse, unintentional moments of hilarity, that belie its occasional stretches of inspiration or sweetness."
"It Chapter Two is comparably a lot less focused and vastly more distracted effort, with Muschietti clearly having difficulties in cohering all of his film's scary parts to tackle his daring take on trauma."
Character development is attempted but unfortunately never reaches a level that evokes true emotion.
"Though no one could accuse It Chapter 2 of playing it safe, the 170-minute runtime often misplaces its focus."
Sluggish and overlong compared to its stellar predecessor.
"In a stunning turnaround, Muschietti improves on the failures of It in practically every aspect."
"With a little less Pennywise and a bit more character-depth and focus on the fear associated with the protagonists' everyday lives, IT: Chapter 2 got the balance just right."
"IT: Chapter Two traded frights for humor, which is a big disappointment for fans of the 2017 film who are expecting an elevated experience with more nightmares."
"The performances were solid and the humor was spot-on. However, we needed more effective horror to tip that scale. Despite its flaws, fans were given an emotionally-satisfying conclusion for our beloved Losers' Club."
"It Chapter Two is a rare sequel that improves upon its predecessor with an invigorating cast, a compelling story, hair-raising scares and heart-wrenching emotion."
"The casting is strong, the film has a genuinely epic sprawl, and for every moment of dodgy CGI there's another that feels creative and alarming."
[G]oodness this is disappointing and dismally slow old stuff.
"As good as the horror-schlock of IT was, this way-overlong sequel pales in comparison by simply not containing sufficient scares. Or, indeed, any scares at all."
"A peculiar mix of the crowd-pleasing and the patience-testing, veering wildly between the entertaining and the frustrating, built round a story that ventures inexorably underground without ever getting to the heart of what lies beneath."
"The best it seems to be aiming for is to be unnecessarily gross, not scary in any way."
The various points of humor and easter eggs for fans make for a fun film. [Full Review in Spanish]
The effectiveness of this film doesn't lie in the scares so much as it does in the internal conflict of its characters. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Everything feels inevitable, like an iceberg and I have no remedy. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"""It Chapter 2 ""engages in an interesting, emotional and not at all trivial discourse on the scars of memory and the dreadful human fragility when facing the worst of themselves and others individually. [Full Review in Spanish]"
It Chapter Two fails in what should be its most important aspect: it's just not scary. [Full review in Portuguese]
"""It,"" that generic title, demonstrates that in pop culture, there is always a second chapter. There's no such thing as just one evil clown."
"Pennywise proves that he is what nightmares are made of -- quite literally. With the perfect mix of gruesome, psychological, and pure terror, IT Chapter Two is a must see!"
The result is a film with all the unsettling power and visual elan of the kiddy-friendly Goosebumps series (Jack Black + monsters = zzzz).
"It Chapter Two frustrates in all of its ambition, for the impeccable performances and deliciously dark storytelling are forever at the mercy of a messy, over-indulgent script."
"Despite some flaws, IT Chapter 2 concludes the saga while maintaining the integrity of Stephen King's story. [Full Review in Spanish]"
The second half of the story plays like a bland re-telling of the first.
"As distinguished as it is disarming, IT Chapter Two could very well be the ultimate adaptation of a Stephen King novel."
And as the master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock once said: 'The length of a film should be directly related to endurance of the human bladder' - and It: Chapter Two just goes too far.
"Too indulgent and messy at times which is a huge shame. There are some great moments and maybe it was the anticipation, but It Chapter Two was sadly disappointing."
"IT felt dated and barely different to the first - and so, so, soooo long.This is a film that ends about four times, none of them in a particularly satisfying fashion."
The great news is that Tulsa's Bill Hader is the best thing about this sequel.
The sequel returns with the same virtues and flaws as the first film. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Savage, scary sequel that's overly long and better suited for a TV mini-series."
"I enjoyed the narrative and the character interactions, but considering it's supposed to a horror movie, it didn't scare me that much. [Full review in Spanish]"
The major fault of 'Chapter Two' is that the overall focus is so incohesive... but friggin' Bill Hader.
...See It Chapter Two to fill your time.
"It Chapter Two does an admirable job of elevating its subpar inspiration into something engaging, but it can't help but pale in comparison to its predecessor."
Pennywise now carries with him a partially-deflated balloon.
"Bill Hader gets MVP and the special effects are first-rate. But in the end, the film is an extravagant display of excess that gets predictable and convoluted."
'Chapter Two' is an emotional finale that takes a few detours that detract from its overall quality.
The first chapter stands as one of the best horror movies of the last few years. This one is just... adequate.
"The special effects are so frequent and over the top that they begin to lose their effectiveness. The lighting or lack thereof on Pennywise's entrances and exits help set a scary tone, but not enough."
One of the curious things that becomes apparent early on [...] is that this portion of the story is served far worse by the splitting of the timelines than its predecessor.
"IT Chapter Two is, in many respects, a very different film from its predecessor, but what the story gets at thematically is an effective fulfillment of what has already been established."
IT Chapter Two is a thrilling and heart-felt conclusion to the story of our favorite losers that captures the feel of King's novel while still giving us something exciting and new.
Grown Goonies in the Boonies.
"Yes, there are big-bang scares, but they're not real scares. In the end, what I come away with is a sense of being at a carnival fun-fair. Attractions, bits...but too much, and you're tired and sick."
"Instead of building on the foundation of its first entry, we're left with seeing a strong cast wasted and an engaging story capped by an ultimately lackluster sequel."
"Chapter Two feels like a missed opportunity. Rather than going for broke, it's content just being the ""evil clown movie."""
"While Chapter Two works perfectly fine as a complement to Chapter One, it still falls short in that the closer our heroes come to triumphing over ""It,"" the further they get from a satisfying conclusion."
"At close to three hours, it's too long and self-indulgent and doesn't scare you much. It's the performances and emotional core which keeps you hooked despite the flaws..."
The scenes that blend the lives of the adults with the lives of the kids they once were are excellent.
"""It"" never decides which fears to take at face value and which exist only in the subconscious, and winds up confused as a result."
"An outsized, sometimes unwieldy monster of a movie that taps into viewers' pleasure centers with horror and humor in equal measure."
"Yes, it is too long, but it's a fitting end to this filming of what was one of Stephen King's longest books, which is really saying something."
"To sum 'It' up, there's a lot going on in this sequel that manages to engage you despite a complex narrative and an exhausting runtime of little less than three hours."
"The trip gets a little murky, but for the most part this is a sound sequel, with spot-on casting that goes much deeper down the Pennywise well, in a pleasantly wrapped package of horror and heart."
"A cryptic head-scratcher of a second half likely to be off-putting to casual moviegoers. If you stick with the Losers until the bitter end, It: Chapter Two is incredibly bold, overwhelmingly bloody, and an undeniably bonkers slice of cosmic pie."
Bill Skarsgard is dreadful rather than dread-inducing. And even scarier than the nearly-three-hour runtime of this frightmare...
"Who could care for nearly three hours? Muschietti's faithful adaptation, with all its creative and creepy set pieces, can't justify that numbing run time..."
"It's obvious that the filmmakers failed to fully reckon with what they've put on the screen, and the results are grim."
"When all is said and done, Chapter Two offers a satisfying ending that feels absolutely earned. Growing up isn't about happy endings, but is about the acceptance of who we are, a realization which inspires strength in the face of absolute terror."
"What It: Chapter Two lacks in gore and terror, it makes up for in actual grime and crud."
"Overall, ""It Chapter Two"" is a fitting companion piece to the first film. There are flaws, to be sure, but nothing you wouldn't expect going in."
It: Chapter 2 retreats from the genuine horror of the 2017 remake towards something less imaginative.
"It's an appreciably less-engaging film in every way, suffering from lurching storytelling, wild vacillations in tone (even within scenes), and a strong cast that never fully gels as a group."
"It: Chapter 2 gazes long and hard at the past, leaving Pennywise juggling scares."
"All in all ... It Chapter Two still packs the right amount of heart, and its emotionally cathartic ending almost makes its drawn-out execution worth it."
"Suffers from an uneven second act and too many flashbacks. However, at other times it comes close to matching the first."
"That said, ""Chapter Two's"" most powerful moments focus on the mental turmoil that continue to ravage the adult Losers years after their adolescent encounters with Pennywise."
Barely recommending this. Take the first film & this one & shrink the whole thing to 3-hours & you have one of the best horror movies ever instead of just a good one.
"I think It's a movie that will make us have fun, that will entertain us, but that will cause a little less nightmares than the first installment. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"""It 2: At Least There's No Sewer Orgy"" is a start-to-finish misfire, from its insensitive opening to an ending that would make Peter Jackson give the ""wrap it up"" signal."
"It's way too long, but scary fun enough of the time. Hader is the standout."
"Of course, horror movies have a long history of playing fast and loose with coherence, and expecting excellence from It Chapter Two is a more foolish idea than anything contained in this extremely dumb movie."
... fans who immediately imagined moving into the Well House on Neibolt Street on sight alone will joyously snuggle in.... suffers from running-time fatigue while rewarding the completionist who hangs onto every detailed breadcrumb.
"Andy Muschietti struck gold with 2017's IT and while Chapter Two may not be as scary, it isn't that far behind either with a respectable silver."
"Not without its charms, but an incredibly overlong sequel that often feels like a chain of video game mini-quests."
"The performances are good, the use of comedic relief is decent, and there are still enough spooky moments present. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, Nudity, Scary Stuff, etc. - also Available)"
"Chapter Two goes deeper than its predecessor, and yet never loses a feeling of shallowness."
Much braver and bolder. [Full review in Spanish]
"It: Chapter Two still has plenty of creepy moments and big creature scares, but it also has the heart that made the first installment so good and popular."
"[Andy] Muschietti and his team are clearly fans of their source material, and they treat the story with a generous humor that even [Stephen] King, in all his self-seriousness, didn't loan to the book."
"It, Chapter Two is nearly three hours, and it feels every second of its running time, oddly meandering when it should be barreling toward its conclusion."
"There's still great grotesque and inventive imagery, a truly dangerous antagonist, and strong chemistry among the cast...but a bigger picture approach would have solved narrative problems and avoided a sense of disconnect that mars the films."
"Goes off the rails in the second half, featuring a loud, garish extended climax that's so bathed in CGI effects that it becomes numbing, an unpleasant visual assault rather than than a creepy funhouse."
"I'm sorry to pop your balloon, but ""It Chapter Two""is a mess."
It's very uneven.
"At its core, It: Chapter Two is about memory, loss, and good versus evil. I just wish it dragged a little less."
"I really like what It Two is about, I just hate how it goes about it."
"A little scattered, bloated and too long, but (...) not a great horror movie in my opinion. but a pretty good movie movie overall."
"The oddest part of Chapter Two is that, despite its length, it fails to earn the ""epic"" status it so wishes to earn."
"It Chapter Two can be a sprawling, unwieldy mess -- overlong, overstuffed and full of frustrating detours -- but its casting is so spot-on ... the film keeps you hooked."
The best part about the movie is that it shows us that true friendship and genuine love do exist. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Substituting breakneck editing and migraine-inducing strobe lights for actual ideas, Muschietti wants to convince you that something exciting is happening."
"Shoddy CGI, a long run time and some iffy character work aside, IT: Chapter 2 is a solid sequel"
"All in, this sequel has enough scares for horror movie fans and enough drama to keep us riveted."
"The new chapter doesn't bring much fresh psychological shading to this process. Instead, the film bombards us with plot and monsters that pile up like toys in the attic."
"Normally, I don't care about a movie's length, but in the case of Chapter Two, length fatigue sets in, overwhelming the movie's virtues. Moreover, last-minute attempts to add sentiment and uplifting instruction doesn't connect emotionally."
"IT Chapter Two is a compelling and satisfying ending to Stephen King's story, even if it's not quite as charming or scary and feels a bit overlong."
"It doesn't sink, but it doesn't necessarily float, either."
"While director Andy Muschietti does a fine job of keeping the creeps coming, after awhile all those chases, attacks, morphing and jump scares just become numbing."
"Pennywise returns, but the film's real star is the 'SNL' alum who makes this mediocrity shine brighter."
"Inevitably, monotony sets in, and by the end you're gasping for fresh invention."
"And even then, set piece after set piece seems constructed with only one aim: a clearly telegraphed jump scare."
"In a particularly strong cast for this kind of film, Hader emerges as MVP. He may not carry the film, but he makes a difference."
There's a nagging sense that it could have been so much more.
"Come for the creatures and scares, stay for the insights on how to let go of your secret shames."
"The whole thing is an overlong, jumbled, unenjoyable mess and the few flashbacks from the first movie only serve to highlight how empty this one feels. I have a new answer when someone asks me what the worst horror movie sequel is."
"The difference between the potential of this sequel and the end result, is staggeringly disappointing."
"Unbearably long yet brimming with ambition, It Chapter Two is a film that seems constantly at odds with itself"
"If nothing else, there's plenty of Pennywise - and Bill Skarsgard remains captivating and terrifying as the demented jester."
"Sticks the landing & then some. This chance-taking, frightful, deeply poignant conclusion is a beautiful phantasmagoria that deepens what came before it while provocatively & rather astutely delving into decades-spanning reverberations of trauma & grief."
"How's that old saying about ""too much of a (mediocre) thing"" go, again?"
"This film has a lot of pacing issues and struggles to find a consistent tone. However, it still nails a lot of the elements that makes Stephen King's work memorable."
"The film argues we're stronger and better when we're home, building communities that can oppress the oppressors and build up so-called ""losers."""
"This movie might make some bucks, but it does not continue the former film's watershed moment."
"The first It brought a robust blockbuster maximalism to the horror genre, and the sequel, like many blockbuster franchises, starts to list from all the baggage."
"The casting is impeccable, and the characters' personalities are so well defined as this point, that ... it truly feels like a reunion of long-lost friends."
"A wearisome sequel by returning director Andy Muschietti that runs nearly three hours, paying tedious obeisance to King's overwritten prose."
The casting here is a triumph.
Just because King makes fun of himself for not being able to write a decent finish doesn't mean we should let him off the hook for this one.
"[F]or those committed to the story and the characters, it does deliver one hell of a massive climax, I just wish it didn't take so long to get there."
"Less engaging and less scary than its predecessor, with a daunting runtime that nevertheless remains a must-see for any horror fan."
"Where the first film showed the raw power of those childhood ties that bind, [It Chapter Two] found ways to show the way that those ties might fade and fray, but never break."
"Though among horror movies [it's] certainly classier than most from a technical perspective, it's overlong, overstuffed with CGI effects, and terribly repetitive."
"It's too long, too repetitive, and just too much."
"Considering the challenges associated with adapting the second half of the novel, the filmmakers have done an adequate job, which is probably all that's needed to make Chapter Two a major box office success."
"This film never reaches the giddy heights of its sleekly efficient predecessor, and that's all down to shoddy construction."
"It: Chapter Two is all bark and no bite, featuring a ridiculous antagonist that perfectly matches the preposterous universe it inhabits."
"This megabore, legacy aside, runs 2 hours and 45 minutes and doesn't do a thing to help itself."
"Ultimately, IT Chapter Two is a movie that had massive potential to be something great, but instead settles for being merely okay. It stays in the shadow of the first movie, which is just a crying shame."
"Though ultimately satisfying, it doesn't get at the deep-seated creeps its predecessor did."
"""Chapter Two"" languishes over two hours and 49 minutes and it feels even longer because of its structure."
"Rather than using the extended running time to dig deep into these characters, director Andy Muschietti, who also directed the original, piles on the frights in a manner that builds to an ending drenched in hysteria."
"Muschietti and his newly expanded cast come through pretty satisfyingly at points. But they also come up short at others, and at still others shift priorities entirely to concentrate instead on ante-upping chills."
"Some poor choices and an overly bloated running time aside, the film is able to dodge its repeated self-critique just barely, as there is more to recommend with It Chapter Two than not."
"Despite the starry cast, these older versions are nowhere near as engaging as the kids."
"However, all is forgiven once It Chapter Two tightens the screws in its final act and the Losers close in an overconfident (and, by this point, way oversized) Pennywise."
More bloat than float.
"Having effectively lured moviegoers in, the filmmakers have no clear or coherent idea of how to wrap things up and take so long to do so that even fans of the first film may find themselves coming out of this one feeling exhaustion rather than terror."
"Sure, It Chapter Two runs nearly three hours long, but unless you suffer from sciatica or, God help you, coulrophobia, it's a helluva ride and a fitting capstone to the best cinematic Stephen King adaptation in recent memory."
"This extended conclusion is just more of the same, with an unfortunate unwillingness to develop its characters, its ideas, or its methods."
Returning director Andy Muschietti - no doubt buoyed by the unexpected success of the first film - seems to have wilfully misunderstood the difference between a miniseries and a movie.
Chapter Two is so stuffed with the slam-dunk of past memories and visceral jump scares that the latter become a touch predictable.
It' not difficult to say that It: Chapter 2 is superior to its predecessor. [Full review in Spanish]
'It Chapter Two' supplies King-sized chills.
"Despite the run time, somehow it remains just as nerve-rattling, creepy and unsettling as its predecessor."
"Your fear that the movie will never end is the most palpable fear offered by Chapter Two, which substitutes spectacle for the creeping, escalating dread the story is meant to have, and that the first movie had in modest amounts."
"The various ghouls that besiege the grown-up Loser's Club, all visions of Pennywise, are silly, textureless creations. With them, suspense is in short supply."
Mostly nonsensical but oddly watchable. It's kind of like watching an exuberant 6-year-old try to tell a story that keeps getting away from her.
...could have been called Jump Scares: The Movie.
"Aside from its excesses and narrative unevenness, It Chapter Two will not disappoint the fans of King's literary universe. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Manages to give It the proper, emotional conclusion many feel King failed to deliver on."
"Occasionally entertaining, sometimes terrifying,and exhaustively long, 'It Chapter Two' throws everything it can at the screen and hopes that it sticks."
"Almost as scary but not quite as grabby as Chapter One, the grownup second half of Stephen King's horror saga is lifted by a great Bill Hader and Bill Skarsgård's iconic psycho clown Pennywise, but hobbled by a nearly three-hour run time."
I was really impressed with the fact that this movie brought heart when it needed to bring heart [and] brought the tears when it needed to bring the tears.
"""It Chapter Two"" is a funny, gross and indulgently long slog through nearly three hours of convoluted clown carnage adapted from the second half of King's 1,138-page best-seller from 1986."
"Another high-energy, heavy-heart funhouse tour of clown-based terror and troubled minds."
"IT Chapter Two has flickers of fright, but is ultimately undone by an arduous runtime. The scares that work are overpowered by big-budget CGI theatrics."
"If it was an episode of Friends, you'd call the 'present day' portion of It: ""The One With All the Weird S***""."
"Sure, It Chapter Two runs nearly three hours long, but unless you suffer from sciatica or, God help you, coulrophobia, it's a helluva ride and a fitting capstone to the best cinematic Stephen King adaptation in recent memory."

"Your fear that the movie will never end is the most palpable fear offered by Chapter Two, which substitutes spectacle for the creeping, escalating dread the story is meant to have, and that the first movie had in modest amounts."
"The various ghouls that besiege the grown-up Loser's Club, all visions of Pennywise, are silly, textureless creations. With them, suspense is in short supply."
Mostly nonsensical but oddly watchable. It's kind of like watching an exuberant 6-year-old try to tell a story that keeps getting away from her.
...could have been called Jump Scares: The Movie.
"Aside from its excesses and narrative unevenness, It Chapter Two will not disappoint the fans of King's literary universe. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Manages to give It the proper, emotional conclusion many feel King failed to deliver on."
"Occasionally entertaining, sometimes terrifying,and exhaustively long, 'It Chapter Two' throws everything it can at the screen and hopes that it sticks."
"Almost as scary but not quite as grabby as Chapter One, the grownup second half of Stephen King's horror saga is lifted by a great Bill Hader and Bill Skarsgård's iconic psycho clown Pennywise, but hobbled by a nearly three-hour run time."
I was really impressed with the fact that this movie brought heart when it needed to bring heart [and] brought the tears when it needed to bring the tears.
"""It Chapter Two"" is a funny, gross and indulgently long slog through nearly three hours of convoluted clown carnage adapted from the second half of King's 1,138-page best-seller from 1986."
"Another high-energy, heavy-heart funhouse tour of clown-based terror and troubled minds."
"IT Chapter Two has flickers of fright, but is ultimately undone by an arduous runtime. The scares that work are overpowered by big-budget CGI theatrics."
"If it was an episode of Friends, you'd call the 'present day' portion of It: ""The One With All the Weird S***""."
It's fascinating how much It: Chapter Two feels like a horror take on the huge superhero team-ups we've become so accustomed to in the last half-decade.
"An awkward mix of humor and horror that brings Stephen King's ""It"" to a disappointing end."
"An investing, if overindulgent scare piece that, like its predecessor, succeeds on an emotional and comedic level."
"Even without the cohesive story and Spielberg-ian charms of the first film, the sequel still delivers ample shock and awe."
"Neither of these movies should be considered truly scary, but they are damn sure engaging and brought to life by performers that sell the drama while poking fun at the ridiculousness of the situation"
"Real trauma is given the same consideration as a literal funhouse of horrors, which cheapens what the characters and audience are put through."
It's a movie that whenever all else fails (regularly here) sends for the digital effects team.
"IT CHAPTER TWO is clunky, too long, and not as scary as it could have been, but when it hits, it really hits."
"At least returning screenwriter Gary Dauberman sets up a running gag about Bill's inability to end any of his books well, a charge that could be leveled at King...whose source material is, frankly, one of these films' biggest problems."
"A flabby, nearly three-hour affair where everything matters so therefore, nothing does."
"It Chapter Two is a less terrifying rollercoaster than the first entry, but still a victorious conclusion. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"A bigger misfire than its predecessor, and a waste of a great cast. Unsupportably overlong, with a feel-good self-care denouement that's almost dangerous. The only terrifying thing here is the tedium."
I found myself both thrilled and emotionally tethered to these characters in ways that eluded me for most of the running time.
"When the nightmare becomes a daydream, it is best to call It a day."
"It's a huge movie, even longer than 2017's first chapter, but there's never a dull moment as each scene carries some sort of freak-out. And even though it's corny and far, far too long, there are plenty of scary bits and strong emotions too."
"Though it sometimes feels less focused than its predecessor, It Chapter Two is still heartfelt and horrifying in equal measure."
"Equal parts bloated and plodding, IT: Chapter Two ends up a disappointing misfire."
"This is an improvement on the first film; darker, scarier and more heart-breaking as promised, and while the structure is clunky and the big CGI moments are still, well, big CGI moments, this is an ending die-hard King fans can be happy with."
"It's fun watching a group of talented actors play the grown-up versions of the kids but when it comes to the horror, it's a case of more of the same."
It just isn't good enough. I can't take It any more. I'm over It.
"Much longer than it needs to be, the dedication to the visceral imagery of Stephen King's twisted novel and rock solid performances (notably Bill Hader) makes ""It Chapter Two"" worth the investment."
"If it teaches no other lesson, It Chapter 2 does suggest that children in peril are more affecting and scary than are adults plotting at (extreme) length to take down a monster."
Chapter Two... gets lost in its own excess and wobbles too much on its precarious tightrope of tones.
"Horror works best when you give yourself over to the creative forces, and here, that decidedly does not happen. ""It: Chapter Two"" is monotonous, overlong, and just not scary."
"That sheer much-ness is in the spirit of King's massive book. ""Chapter Two"" is, for better or worse, a horror carnival."
"[It Chapter Two] delivers more horror, more humour and more heart."
"It: Chapter 2 had me floating away with the feeling I've spent five hours with this series, with no real thoughts other than seeing a missed opportunity."
"Sounds like it was cribbed off a particularly pompous stack of inspirational posters, with lots of guff about promises and ""the things we wish we could leave behind""."
"'It' goes out with a bang---full of strangeness and suspense, a jack-in-the-box of jolts and jumps, oozing and clattering and shrieking with freak-show, gross-out, goose-bump weirdness and hair-raising, FX terrors."
the best horror film of the year... there's a couple of killer scares here that even the most desensitized film fan will goosebump-up over
"Not as good as the first film, yet an entertaining and satisfying conclusion to the whole scary affair. [Full review in Spanish]"
"If Muschietti's achievement with these two features is one more of managerial smarts and problem-solving than anything else, still his skill and control is welcome."
"While it settles into its own rhythm for the first two hours, it certainly doesn't whizz by. The casting is perfect and I enjoyed the jump scares, but overall it's not very frightening, or involving."
"It is Big Chills as the Losers Club reunions in Derry 27 years after first defeating evil shape-shifting Pennywise, and now we have the concluding chapter of Stephen King's clown show- and IT is even better than the first one."
"While It Chapter 2's childhood sentiments come off less believably through an adult lens, the sequel recaptures the lovable heart and humor of its dark predecessor. A brilliant Hader is largely to thank, keeping this big, bulging beast afloat."
"The second film meanders, sagging in the middle, and devoting far too much time to a final showdown between our protagonists and their foe."
"While it has some pacing issues, by and large, this concluding chapter in the IT saga is a scary, hilarious, emotionally charged, and satisfying adaptation of King's most ambitious novel ever. Despite a few minor flaws, I absolutely adored it."
"A fantastically chilling thrill-ride that knowingly hides a tender heart, lulling you into a sense of safety before rattling you to your core."
"Bloody, surreal and at times confounding, It Chapter Two is an ambitious slice of cosmic horror bolstered by strong performances, enthusiastic direction and a fantastic (in all sense of the word) monster."
"This is a solid, extremely well-crafted, great-looking and occasionally quite chilling film, with terrific performances by the grown-ups as well as the returning kids."
"It traverses gutting emotional terrain, saved by an excellent cast..."
"Pennywise's evils have a numbing effect. He's capable of blood-curling murder and yet lacks a truly scary bogeyman appeal. You've seen one shape-shifting scam, you've seen them all."
"There's nowhere else to go: history repeats itself, the film tells us. So does trauma. And so, apparently, do movies."
"Director Andy Muschietti and screenwriter Gary Dauberman have managed to masterfully illustrate that the most terrifying aspect of any horror story comes, not from its spine-chilling supernatural boogieman, but from the monsters we encounter in real life."
"It's all incredibly Jungian, dredging up their shadows in order to face them. But in the process, it becomes clear the horrors of the real world are so much more horrifying than any giant murderous statues, puking ghouls or elderly wraiths."
"It Chapter Two loses its charm and mystery from the first film, and what we're left with is a horror film that feels more like a comedy."
"Slick, self-indulgent, never-ending."
It's a whole lot less scary or fun the second time around.
Delivers the emotional catharsis King's epic horror tale deserves.
"Skarsgard finds new ways to totally freak you out, even in a surprisingly human fashion."
"It Chapter Two is in many ways a victim of its own success, a sequel virtually assured a vast audience that proceeds to undermine its virtues by conspicuously overplaying them and overstaying its welcome."
"Not as impactful or dynamic as the first chapter, but this king-sized freak show is a welcome variation in a cinematic landscape crowded with little spooky houses. [Full review in Spanish]"
"The film is an achievement in big-budget horror storytelling, and an excellent adaptation of King's work. It is weird and messy and ultimately uplifting, with a strong cast and some serious scares."
"Creepy, affecting and brilliantly crafted, It Chapter Two is a sequel that lives up to expectations."
"It's a pacey, if episodic, romp that never drags despite its epic runtime and feels true to the spirit of the book, while not sticking religiously to the letter of the text."
Full of effective sequences in search of a story. A big step down from Chapter One.
great performances power a dark and emotional narrative which erupts into a psychotic trippy nightmare
"The cast is strong, the script is engaging, and director Andy Muschietti delivers a solid story with plenty of scares."
"Even if the film is mostly too lacking in narrative momentum to be truly suspenseful, it retains a disturbing quality which stems precisely from Muschietti's willingness to court the absurd."
"Incredibly satisfying, because it feels like every moment in the first chapter eventually does pay off, some in quite emotional ways."
I think the best part of this film is the cast. They cast the most perfect ensemble of actors to play this grown-up version of these kids because they look exactly the same.
"It Chapter Two does't quite stick the landing, but offers plenty for horror and King fans alike. Lacking slightly in the magic of the first film, this is a darker, more straight forward scarefest that is all but guaranteed to give you nightmares."
"Emotionally resonant, gripping and packed with good performances, IT: Chapter Two rips through its protracted run time."
An intermittently horrifying experience.
"Hader rises above the rest. If you've seen ""Barry,"" his HBO series, you know he has no problem blending comedy and drama. In this case, he adds horror to the mix, and he's just as good at that, too."
"Overall, IT: Chapter Two reminds audiences that horror film sequels can be good with Skarsgård reinforcing Pennywise's position as the scariest clown ever."
"It's an admirable attempt, and there's a lot of artistry on show here, but there's no escaping how truly unwieldy the final product is."
The biggest problem with It Chapter Two is IT
"Andy Muschietti did a great job of not only staying faithful to the source material, but also adding fresh spins and ideas to this adaptation of a Stephen King classic. If you're a fan of the first movie (like me), you'll love this sequel."
"Thanks to Bill Hader, the story becomes extremely fun. [Full review in Spanish]"
The really scary thing is the runtime.
"Really, the main problem with Chapter Two is that it goes on, and on, for so very long."
"IT: Chapter Two mixes blockbuster effects with characters with whom you can believe you are there. If the film is a core of King's legacy, I suspect he's now a very happy man. The Losers live on forever."
"IT Chapter Two isn't as refined as the first, but it's still an excellent ensemble piece, oozing with heart and packed with extremely well-crafted set pieces. Muschietti weaves the young and adult Losers together well, giving the sequel an epic feel."
"Certain story points should have been expanded upon rather than being scattered across the second act, but director Andy Muschietti and company have crafted something fans of the first will get a kick out of."
"At ten minutes shy of three hours, the movie expands constantly (not unlike a certain red balloon) to the point where it just bursts, and all you're left with is entertaining but ultimately unnecessary filler."
"It Chapter Two isn't better than Chapter One. It's certainly not scarier. Here's the thing, though: when it counts, it's every bit as thrilling."
It: Chapter Two asks us how we all deal with wounds we tried to protect and the people you've left behind.
"Hader's wonderful ability to meld humour and horror, using each to animate the other, is the best special effect that money can buy."
"When it comes down to it, It Chapter Two just isn't all that scary."
I think the best part of this film is the cast. They cast the most perfect ensemble of actors to play this grown-up version of these kids because they look exactly the same.

"Hader's wonderful ability to meld humour and horror, using each to animate the other, is the best special effect that money can buy."
"When it comes down to it, It Chapter Two just isn't all that scary."
"It is just so pointlessly long: approaching three hours, with our heroes finally beginning to assume a glassy-eyed solemnity like Hogwarts graduates or the Fellowship of the Ring."
"So it isn't as good as It: Chapter One. That doesn't mean it's not a good time. The filmmakers have assembled a cornucopia of nightmare fuel, or at least a heck of a lot of amazing jump scares..."
"The journey isn't as tight or as focused as the last film, but Muschietti manages to successfully close the book on the Losers' Club with his frightening and emotional It: Chapter Two."
"It's a genuine shame that It Chapter Two doesn't quite connect in the same way Chapter One did, but perhaps half a masterpiece is better than none at all."
"IT CHAPTER TWO is full of laughter and pain. Fun and terror. Fear and triumph. The cast, especially Bill Hader, completely knock it out of the park."
"An immensely satisfying, often thrilling adventure film."
"The movie's third act makes up for this in a thrilling conclusion to this epic two-parter, one that may leave some fans with a nostalgic tear in their eye rather than thoughts of a sleepless night ahead."
"A psychologically merciless sequel, everything here is as it should be: deeper, scarier, funnier. Muschietti in particular has stepped up, skilfully guiding us through a rollicking funhouse. It is obscenely entertaining."
"Superbly effective and vividly executed, Hader is the heart and soul of the horror epic."
"Literally doubling the number of actors that played key roles in its predecessor, 2017's Chapter One, the film puts excellent thesps in the parts but winds up feeling much less satisfying."
"Ambitions aside, 'It Chapter Two' undercuts its horror and drama with consistent quips, while certain narrative choices undercut its grand themes and grander scope. Meanwhile, the entire second act exists as a way to essentially replay the first film."
"This 2-hour-49-minute movie drags more than it jumps, wearing out its premise and possibly also your patience as it lumbers toward the final showdown."
"Although marred by pacing issues and some shoddy CGI, It Chapter Two still has enough creepy set-pieces and solid performances to bring the saga to an effective, albeit formulaic, conclusion."
"Not as good as it could've been, but good enough! Bill Hader is MVP, but sadly Pennywise spends too much time on the bench..."
"A bacchanal of blood, brutal beauty, and bold vision, Muschietti brings King's wicked nightmare factory alive again with all its terrifying, unhinged madness and gory glory."
An elaborate fun-house horror movie that springs pop-up gimmicks and boogie-boogie scares steadily enough to excuse its been-there story and self-important 169-minute running time.
"For all its clumsy storytelling faults, here is a movie that faithfully understands what makes Stephen King's prose so powerful."
"It's an overlong carnival for the senses, and that's in addition to Pennywise continuing to give clowns like Bongo Bonzo and Catty Watty a bad name."
Huge kudos goes to Muschietti for again capturing the essence of King's magnum opus.
t: Chapter Two doubles down on the exhausting jump scares and CGI that plagued the 2017 original. Yet for all its faults-and there are many-it's still an enthralling and emotionally affecting piece of blockbuster filmmaking.
