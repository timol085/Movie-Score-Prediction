review
"James Cameron's Avatar sequel has stunning visuals that get elevated on a big IMAX screen. However, the plot is less than engaging, the dialogues are clunky, and you wish it was shorter."
"The preservation of our woods is the central topic of the first Avatar film and the topic of Avatar: The Way Of Water is ocean preservation. To summarize, don’t doubt James Cameron."
"The special effects are breathtaking...Like all sequels, the original was a bit better."
Technology used to make the film is so compelling and masterful that everything else is an afterthought.
"Whatever may be wrong with it, Avatar: The Way of Water is pure, unabashed cinema, with some of the most glorious visuals ever put to screen and an endlessly absorbing soundtrack."
The Way of Water is somehow even better than its already masterful antecedent.
"The Way of Water clearly sets itself apart from other blockbusters, building on 13 years of preparation to deliver a memorable cinema experience. A visually, technically breathtaking adventure, particularly in the truly stunning underwater sequences."
"The Way Of Water  is not just one of the best sequels ever created… it’s a god damn masterpiece. Breathtaking, visually stunning, & epic in every single way. I’m truly speechless by what James Cameron has crafted"
"Would you like to go on venture number three in the world of Pandora? After the first one, I would have said, “no, thanks”, but now, bring it on."
"As with the first film, it’s impossible to deny that audiences will be treated to a visual feast in The Way of Water, but those looking for a more character-driven movie will be left adrift in the open water."
"Unlike every CGI-heavy theme park ride, the fact that the spectacle and the action sequences never undermine the narrative or emotionally stirring moments is mind-boggling."
"We’re nowhere close to Cameron at his best, but I feel we’re approaching something worth experiencing."
We can accept a barebones revenger because it lets us reacquaint ourselves with Pandora. Cameron is easing us back in with a conflict we don't need to expend too much energy on so we can absorb everything else in the background.
"I’ll say this for James Cameron: At this point, he can slap his name on an old print of Plan 9 From Outer Space, re-release it as Avatar 3: The Way of Outer Space, and incessantly hype it until it crosses the billion-dollar mark and racks up the awards."
This is a blatant example where the visual spectacle (it can dazzle but also fatigue) swallows up an unexceptional story.
"It might be tiresome in a world less lovingly, painstakingly rendered than Pandora, which has no shortage of eye-boggling backdrops to distract us from the humdrum interpersonal conflicts and the cheeseball dialogue, a Cameron staple."
"By the time Cameron finishes these things he’ll be a form of consciousness uploaded to the Cloud, married to a hologram of Mia Goth."
A lot of audiovisual marvels offer a sensible mark upon a film that does not reach greater depths.  [Full review in Spanish]
"Why not strip it down to the sincere basics? Get the family out of the forest faster, and for a more respectable reason. In fact, the subplot of the forest family living among the water people is way better than the main plot. Gorgeous though."
"It’s a shame that female characters have devolved since the first film, which came out over a decade ago."
"But the film, for all its scale and excess, for all its lovingly detailed environments, feels bloated and less than the sum of its parts."
"Avatar: The Way of Water is nothing short of a cinematic marvel, outweighing its predecessor on many fronts."
Avatar: The Way of Water is more of an attraction than the movie itself - magnificent technology is swapped for dialogue deprived of meaning.
You can't deny: Experience matters.
"The visual experience is impressive and immersive, but it's no longer novel, which makes the hokeyness of the story — about the battle between the Indigenous inhabitants of the planet Pandora and would-be Earth colonizers — more noticeable."
"Avatar is like some rare mineral, produced by one man's ill-conceived aesthetic taste placed under the immense heat and pressure of the blockbuster industry. The product is scintillating, beautiful, and feels fairly useless."
"Cameron ... has been fortunate to have emerged—and could only have emerged—in a culture that demanded so little: efficiency, productivity, special effects innovation, sustained bursts of mechanical spectacle, a minimum level of dramatic believability."
"[M]oviegoers have waited 12 years for Cameron’s sequel to finally arrive. Luckily its time has come, and Avatar: The Way of Water does not disappoint."
James Cameron has done it again.
...a thoroughly needless followup that easily stands as Cameron’s least effective endeavor to date.
"In The Way of Water Cameron seems to be joyously beckoning for us to step into his mind and into a new world, so that even in the elegiac tone of the ending there is level of sweet kindness that feels new even for him."
The Way of Water is surprisingly conservative in its celebration of family and especially fatherhood.
"In the midst of all the techno-wizardry, using mo-cap to empower Sigourney Weaver to play her own teenage daughter turns out to be Cameron’s greatest stroke of genius."
"James Cameron once again crafts a beautiful visual world, but the script sags with repetitive story beats and an endless final battle. I'm thrilled the Oscars are nominating blockbusters again, but this is the weakest of the 10 Best Picture nominees."
"It’s about what you would expect from writer-director James Cameron, a.k.a. Cecil B. DeMotionCapture. Like DeMille’s later films (not his early, edgier fare) and the original ""Avatar,"" the sequel is big, spectacular and dumb."
"Sans water, that annoying motion-smoothing soap-opera look bubbles up, gimmickry sets in, and Pandora and the Na'vi appear far, far less visually spectacular."
Pretty to look at but shallow deep.
A cinematic feast that shows the future of filmmaking is here.
"Luckily for Cameron, it's hard to check your watch while wearing 3D glasses."
"If you’re already a fan of the first Avatar, you will welcome a return to the realm of Pandora. Those who were lukewarm or hostile to the original won’t find anything new enough to merit consideration."
"For three whole hours, Avatar: The Way of Water evokes Important Issues — imperialism, colonialism, racism, sexism, ransacking the environment for commodifiable resources — in the silliest, shallowest way possible."
"Cameron remains nearly unparalleled when it comes to crafting an action sequences, but it's the moments of sheer beauty in The Way of Water that really linger"
Appropriation and privilege run rampant throughout the development of this entire franchise.
"Second time around, it feels as though Cameron was way too happy to simply rehash a number of story points ripped straight from the first Avatar, with minor cosmetic changes slapping on a fresh coat of paint that quickly turns stagnant"
"A magnificent audiovisual cathedral in which technology, creativity and hart row in the same direction, justifying by itself the existence of the big screen."
"...one of cinema’s great blockbuster artists is back, and he’s delivered a film so packed with spectacle that even the original “Avatar” pales in comparison."
I'm not sure anyone cares about Jake Sully and his family as much as James Cameron thinks they do.
Cameron did what he did in 2009 and he did it better. He once again is redefining what cinema’s future can be in the digital and technological age.
Watch the film for its wonderfully crafted images that make you feel like you’re actually on an alien planet. The film’s message of loving your family and facing upheavals together as one will resonate with the Indian audience for sure.
"Everything feels authentic, yet it’s also technically marvelous. There’s something masterful about what Cameron can do and it's refreshing to have this story take place outside of a long-lived IP where every plotline is on its third or fourth recycling."
"The Way of Water is predicated on an escapist mindset that prevents moviegoers from thinking (or expressing dissatisfaction). When a film like this is sold for its 3D, 48-frames-per-second High Dynamic Range teachnology, protect your credit card."
"What you make of Avatar: The Way of Water depends largely on whether you’re inclined to give Cameron the benefit of doubt. In that, the film proves that there are some things that Cameron gets right, he does so with faultless precision."
"I loved this movie. The first Avatar is emotionally hollow, but The Way of Water is this film about family, and trying to save your family, and it's done with such vigorous sincerity that the emotion is really strong."
"[A] substantial offering that fixes most of the mistakes from its first entry. And, of course, it's beautiful to observe. Cameron spent years of his life creating a fictional world worthy of its own National Geographic documentaries."
"#AvatarTheWayOfWater is epic, grand, and simply a masterpiece from both a filmmaking and technological viewpoint. 
James Cameron creates a cinematic experience with a level of craft that seldom exists in the blockbuster space."
"Gorgeous imagery aside, The Way of Water feels less like a sequel than it does a refamiliarisation of the world and ideas of the 2009 blockbuster. There are simply too many ideas with not enough focus to justify its gigantic runtime."
"Three hours breeze into deep relationships, action-packed sequences, and a tale that deserves to be repeatedly seen in cinema. #diandrareviews"
"The Bottom-line: ""Avatar: The Way of Water is Epic, Exhilarating, and Entertaining"
A fortune has been spent to return the movies to where they were a century ago.
"I suspect Cameron suffers from Bono Syndrome: namely, an unshakable belief in one’s own messianic genius, combined with a compulsive need to save the planet, or rather be seen to be saving the planet."
"Clocking in at three hours and 12 minutes, ""Avatar 2"" takes too long to get a story going. When it does, we realize it’s basically the same story, just with new treasure and another group of blue creatures who also are leery of the “sky people.”"
I just wish all of the technical achievements made it a more interesting story.
I was blown away by the effects and the world building and will happily return for the third film. It’s safe to say I’m on board with the ‘Avatar’ franchise.
"Avatar: The Way of Water is much, much more of an action film that its predecessor, and James Cameron still has the stones when it comes to creating outrageous sci-fi spectacle that looks like a Frank Frazetta poster on acid."
"Told mostly from the kids point of view,  as beautiful as this film can be, it is not without its issues.  Yet, it is still great family friendly fun"
"This is better than the original. Action in the 2nd act is top notch, the voice acting/motion capture is vibrant, characters new & old have more weight/emotion, and the visuals are so good it took my eyes time to truly grasp IMAX 3D High FPS. IT’S SO EPIC"
It’s a great spectacle that fails to give audiences a reason to re-visit it for actually substantial reasons like interesting characters or relatable conflicts...
"Cameron’s early films mirrored John Carpenter in their sleekly shark-like, ruthless momentum. Now he is Cecil B. DeMille, hawking herculean, hollow spectacles to hold off cinemagoing’s decline."
There are definite problems of logic and lechery despite gorgeous visuals. That's without addressing the problems of the White Savior narrative.
Pure cinematic visual magic...  The way to wonder.  [capsule review]
Cameron is blurring the lines between over-earnest after-school special and bombastic action flick distinctly unsuited to the former's target audience.
"Be that as it may, there’s no getting around the fact that “Way of Water’s” dramatic foundation is leaky.  Then again, you’re not supposed to notice that. Cameron provides distractions aplenty."
You have to hand it to a filmmaker who is willing to devote an entire subplot to a computer-generated whale-like creature that communicates more with its eyes than any human in both Ant-Man movies combined.
The film comes with a glossy sheen to it; essentially a shinier version of what Cameron delivered 13 years ago with Avatar.
"After more than a decade of waiting, Avatar: The Way of Water makes a statement as the most spectacular blockbuster of the year, providing a thrilling ride through the mesmerizing world."
"Hyperbole is maybe the worst thing in the world, but Avatar: The Way of Water utterly redefines visual awe and wonder. It resets the bar so ridiculously high with entire sequences that leave you unsure where physical reality stops and CG begins."
Cameron leans into all the qualities that made him such a successful director.
"Cameron, like he did with sequels to ""Alien"" and ""Terminator,"" once again proves he is the master of upping the ante in terms of both storytelling and spectacle."
The filmmaking craft may be (mostly) astonishing. But the craft must always — <i>always</i> — be in aid of a compelling story populated by compelling characters... and that’s not so much the case here.
Cameron has crafted nothing more than a 3+ hour revenge tale with none of the motivations of the original that is nothing more than a dulling $400 million screensaver and a rehashing of better moments from his career. A waste of our time and his effort.
"Cameron’s always one to push the boundaries, and you’re reminded of that early on if you see it in 3D IMAX. I was quickly in awe of Cameron’s visual storytelling as we return to the lush world of Pandora"
"The movie’s roaring achievement: There’s cinematic genius in every overdetermined frame, every animated motion in shifting frame rates, the relentless photorealistic detail. The sensation is like being trapped in a bathysphere in an aquarium."
"If it hasn’t already been advised by Disney, Avatar’s captain just really needs to either learn to let go or be locked out of the editing room on the next one. Even the most jaw-dropping of action sequences seem stretched or recur unnecessarily.."
"The Way of Water explodes with brilliant colors and fast-moving otherworldly images that, thanks to the 3-D, reside between you and the screen and rarely fail to dazzle the eyes for any lengthy stretch of this more-than-three-hour epic."
"Like the first movie, the technical wizardry won me over and (again, having just rewatched the first movie) the story is deeper and richer."
"It’s not that this is a bad movie, it really isn’t, it just felt soulless. Its attempt to create something profound thematically and narratively falls short and the band of characters sadly just aren’t that interesting - but, hey, at least it looks good."
"Cameron's Avatar sequel is a visual feast, and that's what saves it from the otherwise mediocre characters and arduous runtime."
"The hard core fans will revel in the new “Avatar” and will embrace the new water world like I do. Hopefully, the next one will have an original story, but I do not expect that from Cameron."
"If for nothing else, see it to enjoy the stunning smorgasbord of visual marine delights bequeathed by the director who dove 2.3 miles down in the pitch black ocean, all by himself, to the Mariana Trench. Who does that? Talk about your thorough research."
"[Cameron] is once again unparalleled at presenting us with an ecological and ethnographic survey of a fictional world that is, like the whole concept, familiar and yet novel."
A thundering bore of a film.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
Avatar: The Way of Water rewards the long wait with an extravaganza of special effects cinematic spectacle.
"he case for film as an experience (Cameron’s first priority) depends almost always on its form. On that front, he delivers -- and while it may not always feel revelatory, it’s fine to do an old thing one’s own way, and better still to do it well."
"This film looks fantastic, with state of the art visuals, which are extremely imaginative and arresting. The acting is solid, and the action moves right along, despite the long running time."
"The luminous and tactile CGI that breathes life into the film’s flora and fauna proves that Pandora, not Jake, is the hero of Avatar. Every blade of grass, every drop of water, is a gift not to be wasted."
"It would be missing the point to call the proceedings indulgent to the point of self-infatuation: Cameron has built a new world from the remixed bits of this one, and he seems determined that we should not simply visit Pandora, we should live in it."
"Yes, the three-hour-plus runtime is long, but it's easy to get lost in the movie's memorable world-building. The motion-capture performances are fascinating to behold, and Winslet and Curtis are welcome additions to the cast."
"It’s more than you can possibly imagine. A fantasy world so vivid and real it commands your full attention for 3h 12m.  And when it’s done, you’ll still want to linger in this heightened state of make believe."
"Visually gorgeous, James Cameron's film repeats the original's mistakes."
"While it is absolutely beautiful and an achievement in effects, it has striking similarities to the first film - but that last hour of action is absolutely why we go to the movies. See it on the biggest screen possible with the best presentation."
The innovative technology trumps the elementary storytelling.
"Going into this movie, I thought that I’d at least be wowed by the effects and the action. I never expected to be moved close to tears by blue alien children."
"We get a story this time... that part of it was great, but at 3 hours and 15 minutes, it's just too long."
State-of-the-art special effects and revolutionary underwater cameras can’t hide the fact that Avatar: The Way of Water is basically the same movie as the original with more blue people (some are slightly green now!) that get on your last nerve.
"One of the great films of 2022, Avatar: The Way of Water, is not only a triumph for Cameron, but it’s what we need to continue to demand as audiences."
"If you go just for the escape and spectacle, you will be in awe."
Shamelessly corny and blunt and earnest and wildly exciting.
"Cameron creates a hypnotic experience, holding us by the hand as the camera glides through whirls of ethereal sights, phantasmagoric action sequences and, fan or not, another Cameron monument upon which the box office can hang until at least the new year."
"A thrilling adventure of colossal proportions that dazzles the senses, while packing an emotional punch. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"A towering achievement that offers a visual spectacle like no other, while exploring new themes around family and parenthood. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Cameron is finally back on Pandora and while we're all for messages of environmentalism that doesn't mean we love a recycled story. It stays surface level the entire (long) time but still manages to move along. It still eeks out a fresh status.
"There are microscopic moments with humans, but it looks like a computer game for the majority of the film."
"It’s predictable, shallow and bombastic. This is a low-brow action movie dressed in the glitzy trappings of a high-brow sci-fi flick. Once you take off the 3D glasses, or the rose-tinted ones, the illusion is shattered."
"We have officially lost the great James Cameron to the creatively barren, visually whatever land of Pandora. It was nice knowing him."
"It’s often just damn fun. Yet the missteps are inescapable, and so many of them are due to Cameron’s ego that no matter how much you may enjoy its beauty in the present, it’s hard to look back on it without remembering the flaws."
"The film’s focus is split in so many directions that none of its characters feel whole, even after three full hours."
This bombastic cinematic event was worth the wait.  [Full review in Spanish]
"Even amid its action scenes, the Avatar sequel is about the family drama and their struggles to stay together."
"It has a terrific sense of colour, texture and weight. And some emotional plot threads make what's essentially a blunt-edged battle movie into something surprisingly engaging."
"[James Cameron] remains very much at the center of his obsession. He may not be a great artist, or a visionary, but in its look, and its feeling for family, this behemoth enterprise still has an ardent, cornball grandeur to it."
"The long-awaited sequel to the 2009 film continues its breathtaking saga of Pandora, reuniting audiences with Jake Sully and Neytiri as they protect their young family and ageless traditions."
Avatar: The Way of Water deserves be watched in IMAX 3D. It is the greatest immersive cinema experience of the year — world building at its finest.
"At times, it feels like Cameron is wildly in love with the ecosystem and inhabitants of Pandora, and considerably less in love with the actual story being told. I wish that the narrative could have been as revolutionary and breathtaking as the filmmaking."
"It's one of those movies that needs to be seen on a big screen--please, please, please, don't wait for this to stream on Disney plus--and it needs to be experienced with a crowd of strangers who cheer on every fight...and gasp at every little detail."
The Way of Water feels special in how it’s an astonishing spectacle made with the meticulous care of a serious craftsman.
It’s a marriage of commercial aspiration and artistic achievement that is not often seen.
'Avatar' was about a clash of civilizations. 'The Way Of The Water' is a revenge story that wears thin after a while. The whales were cool though.
"The story may stumble in a few spots, but it’s still an exciting step up from the first movie. And as an experience, visiting Pandora has never felt so exciting and full of life."
Cameron’s world-building is obsessively rich — focal storytelling not as much.
Delivers on its promise of expanding the scope of Pandora.
"“Avatar: The Way of Water” is fully engrossing, always eye-popping and occasionally touching. Like its predecessor, it’s a movie to admire and enjoy, if not quite love."
"[James Cameron] has taken a story that is easy to understand, characters that are easy to root for, and places them in set pieces that are nothing short of spectacular."
"Visually even more glorious than the first Avatar movie, but not much improvement narratively. The underwater scenes are so amazing it’s worth putting up with those pesky 3D glasses once again."
The Special Effects are terrific; the best 3D ever filmed; the story is so ridiculous it's laughable and far too long.
"Avatar: The Way of Water’s epic visuals are impossible to find fault with, but with a paper-thin, painfully boring story and little in the way of character development, this three-hour snoozefest is all style, no substance."
Astonishing! Enthralling! Exciting! Immersive! None of these words could sensibly be applied to the three-and-a-quarter-hour Wet Smurfahontas stodgeathon that is Avatar: The Way of Water.
"It’s a high-stakes film that’s truly epic in scope and scale, set in a well-developed world, but it also has a big heart."
"Working with director James Cameron. screenwriters Amanda Silver & Rick Jaffa develop an emotional arc for each motion-captured character. The result is compelling & wondrous, highlighted by dazzling visual effects, particularly the deep-sea sequences."
"Though a technical spectacle, Cameron has evolved his storytelling from 'Save the Rainforest' to 'Save the Whales.'"
Avatar: The Way of Water is the one film you truly must see in theaters this year.
A soporific and unnecessarily long sequel that beneath the expensive CGI visual effects hides an ocean of recycled formulas in which blue aliens swim on the surface like disposable plastic bottles. [Full review in Spanish]
"In this opening salvo of four sequels, [Cameron] expands digitally rendered horizons from bioluminescent forests to the moon's teeming oceans and resplendent atolls, providing audiences with a compelling reason to immerse fully in eye-popping 3D and IMAX."
Wide eyes become the only tools anyone really needs to enjoy the epic entertainment offered here.
"Cameron is one of the few directors who can hold an audience for over three hours. The world he’s created is lovelier, livelier and more vivid every minute. The plot has enough twists, turns, themes and action to keep you captivated throughout."
It’s an amazing cinematic experience that invites the viewer to let go of everything else – including the expectation of a dramatic narrative with intriguing plot and subtle characterization – and immerse in the wonder of its world.
Immerse yourself.
Director James Cameron delivers another visual spectacle and adds emotional weight that creates higher stakes for everyone
"Avatar The Way Of Water is a jaw-dropping, visually immersive experience that demands to be seen on the biggest screen possible."
The movie’s bland aesthetics and banal emotions turn it into the Club Med of effects-driven extravaganzas.
"Pure, distilled, 3-D cinematic rapture."
"A visual triumph full of impressive filmmaking, Avatar: The Way of Water is hindered by an interesting plot that it can't ever truly elevate."
"...numbing, leisurely slowness..."
"There is a feeling, as this long entertainment that looks great but doesn’t have much to say slowly draws to a close, that part of its job is to set the scene for the Avatars to come."
Avatar: The Way of Water ups the ante visually but still puts spectacle over story.
As a spectacle it’s astonishing. But is this even a film? It’s more like a three-hour theme park ride. Or a superior version of those show-reel display loops they use in shops like Currys to show off how good the tellies are.
There's a lot to pull out of any cultural artifact this immense; you can't make a thing that consumes this many resources and sucks up this much air without being emblematic of the times and circumstances surrounding its creation.
I'm not kidding when I say this may be the best-looking movie I've ever seen.
"If Cameron truly believes in anything, it’s the power of big-screen spectacle, and more than ever he’s determined to give us the works."
"With dynamic characters working in tandem with astonishing technical wizardry, James Cameron’s latest opus is also his most personal."
Cameron redeems himself and the film in the final act...
"Basically, like the original, this is worth a viewing or two. Still, not Cameron’s best, nor will it stand the test of time the way his pre-Titanic work does."
"Perhaps in subsequent films there might also be greater attention to the script. While the new film is a successful and sometimes wondrous visual experiment, as a story, it treads in shallow waters."
"Visually mind-blowing but with a fractured and over-crowded story, this sequel still manages to provide a great spectacle."
"Avatar 2 is just stunning in the parts it skims along the water, dives deep, rolls around joyously, keeping up with the incredible creatures who live in the deep."
An epic action-adventure film that rides on the most stunning visual effects - the 'magic' on the screen looks 'real' for the most part.
"Like the original, it is a big screen spectacle that excels in craftsmanship, so breathtaking that it is easy to forgive the film’s shortcomings (and there are plenty in the rather hefty 192 minute run time)."
"In my idyllic world, it wouldn't be an event movie that's poised to break records for popcorn sales. But in the real world, we probably should be grateful that [it] gives audiences what they pay for — richly realized journeys to other worlds."
"ho doesn’t love iridescent sea creatures, fiery cinders and weapons poking into the theater through the magic of 3D? If there’s only one movie you put on pants and leave the house for, this one is it for the visuals alone."
Avatar: The Way of Water is -- no surprise here -- a world-class display of high-end cinema technology. Not to mention a down-to-the-molecular-level example of imaginative world-building from writer/director James Cameron.
Avatar: The Way of Water is pretty to look at and the 3D technology is impressive. And that’s about the only nice thing I have to say about James Cameron’s film.
"A gorgeous template for a virtual tourist experience, 'Avatar: The Way of Water' is less compelling as a sci-fi adventure."
"James Cameron may not actually be the king of the world, but he is unquestionably the king of the sequel, and Avatar: The Way of Water proves it."
"I was very hyped for Avatar 2. James Cameron has never let me down when it comes to his movies. 
I guess there's a first time for everything."
"As for those visuals, Cameron has been dazzling us for years and the innumerable artists and technicians have created an alien world that seems as real as the view out your window."
"The movie is visually exhilarating, but it suffers from the same problems as the original. The movie is punishingly long, and its thin storyline and cast of imminently forgettable characters don’t provide much payoff."
"The long-awaited sequel reaches new heights in special effects, 3D, and visual immersion. It's a thrill ride that is a must-have theatrical experience. Unfortunately, the characters and story still feel a bit underwhelming and underdeveloped."
"Using whatever alchemy of motion-capture performance, computer-generated animated animals, and the occasional flesh-and-blood actor, Cameron conjures a world with such beauty and majesty that it’s impossible not to get drawn into it."
"The technical achievements of the Avatar franchise are so often celebrated, as if cinema can (or should) be stripped down for parts. A proof of concept for computer animation isn’t a quality film any more than a Twitter bot is a viable political candidate"
"Avatar: The Way of Water finds Cameron challenging himself as a storyteller all while setting the new bar of visual storytelling. Once you dive into Pandora’s oceans, you can’t go back."
"With the same villain, plot and themes, the new “Avatar” follows the same recipe as the old “Avatar.” Just add water."
"This new Avatar filled an awe-shaped void in my heart, and for that, I thank James Cameron."
"Ultimately a very simple, longwinded cat-and-mouse game that, whether intentionally or not, evokes so much of what came before it while managing to break new visual ground."
The Way of Water is an all-ages theme park ride with no height restriction. A film that’s simultaneously pushed and redefined high frame rate and 3D filmmaking.
"The rare sequel that exceeds the original, a full-blown example of old-fashioned spectacle filmmaking married to stunning CGI visuals that seem like a giant leap forward. You can pick it apart afterward, but while you're in sitting there, it works."
"This is a pure cinema experience, not to be missed, and Cameron never resists the urge to throw absolutely everything he has into this clear work of passion."
The Way of Water is a stunning work of art that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible. It's also a film whose visual effects upstage and overshadow everything else as it recycles many of the same ideas and themes of its predecessor.
"You can appreciate the impressive fantasy world-building, meticulous detail in its visual concepts, and sense of wonder in exploring them."
The grandeur is the whole point ... what a remarkable experience it is. Go now. And pick the biggest screen you can find.
"The special effects are dazzling. That's a given. But I'm unsure whether or not the story will reach the audience's heart, or if they'll enjoy it with fascination. I didn't. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Cameron often seems conflicted with the idea that his fun on Pandora might need to function as something resembling a narrative you would find in a movie, a notion that might be a problem if not for the film’s breathtaking beauty."
"... It was the time to take a narrative step forward, but that didn't happen. [Full review in Spanish]"
"A pandemic didn't help, but the cold hard truth is that Top Gun aside, blockbusters this year have been underwhelming and anemic. The Way of Water delivers excitement audiences have been starved for, and then some."
You feel Cameron's passion for this natural world - I say natural fully aware that this is an artificial creation that feels like it has more blood and metal than what we usually get from studio franchise fare.
"I was completely taken in by Avatar: The Way of Water and overwhelmed by its fluid, kinetic action scenes, eye-popping production design and propulsive storytelling. This is a movie filled with wonder, which has become a rare commodity in the age of CGI."
"The Avatar movies continue to be groundbreaking, world-class exercises in cinematic digital artistry, and The Way of Water is a much-needed improvement on the first film."
"Similar to the first movie, even if I have issues with the story, even if there are flaws in the narrative, I can still be completely immersed and swept away by the experience of watching The Way of Water on a gigantic IMAX screen..."
"Brilliantly designed and produced, but narratively muddled, James Cameron’s <i>Avatar: The Way of Water</i> creates a world on screen that lives and breathes on its own separate from anything its audience or characters experience."
"Like its predecessor, The Way of Water isn’t a movie — it’s a technology showcase."
(Cameron) is far more interested in showing you his sandbox than doing anything interesting with it... a dull mix of the original story with even duller right-of-passage subplots. This sequel serves as a grim portent for the films to come.
"The moral combat could not be more simplistic, yet all the Cameron trademarks are in play..."
"Yes, it looks different—and I understand folks who are frightened by things that are new and different; I am frequently one of them—but the difference is in service of attempting to bring people fully within the proscenium of the screen."
"Despite all of the ""James Cameron-isms"" in the story, this is a breakthrough in visual magnificence, another frame by frame evolution in what a movie means. Cameron's in-depth imagination creates a world that is to be seen, experienced and dreamt about."
"Weigh the flimsy story against eye-popping, shoot-the-works visuals that fill the screen to bursting and the choice is clear: Cameron’s 3D sequel to his biggest hit is the ultimate in-theater thrill ride.  You’ve never seen anything like it in your life."
"A towering cinematic achievement of visceral emotion, slam-bang action and jaw-dropping special effects that show just how far a budget of some $350 million can stretch."
"Is this one of the things we want from movies right now — pictures that take long-famous, Oscar-winning actors and bury them so deeply in digital gelatin that passing fantasy fish and phosphorescent flora outshine them at every turn?"
"An incredible structure. When you settle in and start poking around though, all the visual effects in the world cannot truly erase the underwhelming realities Cameron has placed on screen."
"Cynicism has been done to death — leave that at the door. A little wide-eyed wonder isn’t a bad thing. The best films reach not only for awe, but the full gamut of emotions. Open your eyes and open your heart."
"The last act is a combination of James Cameron's greatest hits: Aliens, Terminator, True Lies, and Titanic. He took all his experiences of the years and applied them to this one movie in the best possible way."
"If this is less fully satisfying than the first film, that’s mostly due to it being just one part of a larger whole: once the action finally arrives, Cameron delivers in thrilling style"
James Cameron knows how to elevate simple story structure into an intense action spectacle... (in) the superior CGI... viewers can see the emotion whether it’s spoken or not... an experience unavailable at home unless you live in a multiplex.
"A pretty and empty sequel, James Cameron's ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" relies too heavily on visual effects to compensate for a bad story."
"Simply put, this is an offering that must be seen in the biggest format possible.  And if experienced that way and you simply go along for the ride, oh, what a ride it will be for you. One of the best sheer entertainment offerings of the year."
A satisfying action spectacle.
"Members of the audience will feel immersed in a whole new world... Cameron, to his credit, succeeds in transporting the audience there. Avatar falters, however, in making them care about many of the inhabitants of this visual paradise."
"What good are the medium's most elaborate, awe-inspiring special effects if a film can't tell a story that's new, or alter the way an audience experiences narrative cinema?"
Avatar: The Way of Water was a quite simply a magnificent way to wind up the cinematic year and celebrate the singular joy of the big screen experience with an Avatar as good if not better than its predecessor.
The scenes of Jake and Neytiri’s forest-dwelling family learning to adapt to marine life are full of a kind of joy that it seems Hollywood blockbusters have all but forgotten: that of seeing something unprecedented and wondrous.
"Cameron uses his skills as action director to great effect, particularly in a balls-out third act. Sure, he takes a full hour to set the stage, but there are a couple of emotional payoffs later in the film that justify the initial slog."
"Fantasy is most powerful when creators engage thoughtfully with their chosen allegory, checking all the minute components of their fictional world’s machine. But The Way of Water is a blunt tool, expanding the world of Avatar via copy and paste."
"It's a shame because the spectacle truly is brilliant, as tremendous as Avatar and then some. But there is such thing, as it turns out, as a little too much."
"You'd expect the visuals to be a strength of the movie, but they're not that good. Disney's current Strange World has more imaginative cryptofauna than this movie. The animation... is reminiscent of a top-end video game."
"Story elements aside, the film is movie-going experience that is worth all of the effort and money spent to watch it."
"Visually, the film is stunning, more so than the last, though you can’t escape the fact that it still looks like a video game running on the greatest graphics card of all time. I saw it in 3D Imax and... it’s worth your greenback."
"For those looking for a fully immersive theater experience, Avatar: The Way of Water delivers a sea of blue. But do the breathtaking visuals outweigh the predictable plot?"
James Cameron has once again proved that he really is the king of blockbuster filmmaking.
"All eye candy all the time. ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is spectacular to look at, but too long and lacking in meat."
"Here, anyway, a mere 13 years later, is Avatar 2, and what do we get? Tedium, and lots of it."
"Even if you don’t like the movie, you will be blown away by the experience."
"Way of Water is an excursion in paradise. Would you criticize your week in the Caribbean for not having much narrative drive, or for being populated by thinly realized and interchangeable characters?"
The vibrant variety of colours makes every single frame feel like a photorealistic art piece. A marvellous blend of wonder and terror grows as we go deeper into the cavernous underwater world of Pandora.
"""The Way of Water"" fails to deliver an epic narrative that matches the brilliant visuals. But for most viewers, those visuals will be more than enough."
"Everything here is retread, restate, regurgitate."
"The Way of Water is a bloated, often boring mess of a movie that's nestled inside some of the most amazing visual effects work ever put on the screen."
"By waiting 13 years, James Cameron really does have a new story to tell us, new characters to work with -- and whole box of new film-making wizardry to unpack, out there in Miramar and beyond."
"If I had seen “Avatar: The Way of Water” at home on my television, I would have regarded it as simply a slightly above-average sci-fi/action flick and gone on my way. But on the big screen in 3D, it is the most visually spectacular film I’ve ever seen."
"Everything is tantalizing and made to immerse the viewer in the film experience, but for a film to be successful, it must have a strong story to back up the effects. After all, it's not a video game."
"The bald, button-pushing beats are undermined alternately by Cameron’s unapologetic gun fetishization and overlong “wonder” sequences, turning this into a numbing, three-hour slog instead of an easily achievable two-hour experience."
Avatar should keep audiences pinned to their seats throughout its marathon length because Cameron offers spectacle -- overwhelming amounts of it.
"In that immersive respect, Avatar: The Way of Water predictably delivers a similar, if not identical, sense of awe and wonder its predecessor did more than a decade ago."
"It’s loud, eye-watering, and very uncomfortable. Avatar: The Way of Water wallows in intense navel-gazing to show off its  CGI – yes James, we see the pretty fishies - but all of that is a distraction, and you and your bladder deserved better."
"[A]n embodiment of the power of film to transport us to entirely new worlds, transcendent and astonishing in its ambition and its ability to make us believe. Cameron has accomplished what many deemed impossible. Again."
"The surprisingly swift, 192-minute film stands on its own, and I suspect you could have a good time watching it even if you haven't seen the first ""Avatar."""
"Cameron’s staging of action sequences remains unparalleled, and that buys some goodwill, but by the end of the movie, I was left with Peggy’s Lee’s immortal question: “Is that all there is?”"
"Although the sequel is overlong and light on complex characters, it’s 2022’s most impressive-looking blockbuster."
Impactful and triply enjoyable. [Full review in Spanish]
"The beauty of the world... evoked in lush detail by cinematographer Russell Carpenter, is enough, most of the time, to make you forgive the hokiness of the screenplay by Cameron, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver."
This return to Pan-bore-ra is more interested in technological experimentation than a focused and engaging storyline.
The spectacle of it all IS the point. Everything else is secondary. You will either be wowed by it or you will not. [Full review in Spanish]
"If there was ever a film that could win over those who were agnostic or even antagonistic about the original Avatar, Avatar: The Way of Water would be it."
Groundbreaking.
Still feels more theme park than movie.
"Avatar: The Way of Water is a visually dazzling experience that needs to be seen on the largest screen possible, and in 3-D if it’s available."
"It’s visually and technically magnificent, but woefully deficient in plot, characterization and dialogue."
"No film will ever be this beautiful in my lifetime, at least until the next Avatar."
The thing about this film is that visual effects are not enough to make up for the weak script.
"For portions of that concluding stretch, Cameron's embrace of technology meets his Terminator 2 heyday, washing over you in ways that are almost enough to make you look past the film's flaws."
"The Way of Water is the kind of tremendously entertaining, spectacularly ambitious, not-a-little-bit-silly epic that only James Cameron can, and should, make."
"Loud and proud, Avatar: The Way of Water can be, by times, overwhelming, but it’s also the kind of grand scale movie that demands to be seen on the biggest, most immersive screen possible."
"An improvement on the original, Avatar: The Way of Water is a visually stunning film that entertains despite its flaws."
"It’s dazzling but verging on stillness. But have patience. Because it’s all part of Cameron’s masterful orchestration. The high frame-rate 3D, is so stunning that it will take you a few minutes to adjust to your reality, when you exit the theatre."
"The unrelenting kinetic ferocity of this last act is undeniable, and while nothing that happened came as a surprise, my eyes still remained glued to the screen."
"The story is familiar with many similar themes recycled but the change of setting on Pandora, the focus on new characters, and the stunning visuals make it worth the watch on the big screen in 3D for a more immersive experience."
James Cameron delivers on the spectacle we expect and gives us an engaging story to boot. This is even worth the kidney damage and possible bladder infection I got because I didn’t want to miss a single second of the visual treasure.
[T]he cosmetic change from a vast forest to the beaches and seas of Pandora doesn't cover up how much of this narrative has been recycled from its predecessor...
"Never bet against James Cameron, because no one else builds a circus quite like he does, even if, like all circuses, it loses its glamor when you hold it up to the light."
"Avatar: The Way of Water is a spectacular, immersive, jaw-dropping Hollywood experience that only Cameron can bring to movie theatres."
"Those in search of a rich emotional experience or complex storyline won’t find either here, but those things have never been the director’s bread-and-butter."
"The story is just a scaffolding for the world-building. That may make it more of an experience than a movie, but the experience is a fun place to visit."
There isn't one single frame that isn't a work of art or a single moment where the entertainment and dramatic pulse doesn't hook the audience. [Full review in Spanish]
"Clearly elevated by its technical elements, the film accepts some roughness in plot and pacing to carve out a pathway for its future sequels. With some intriguing setups and personable characters, this could equal a fantastic new cinematic franchise."
"Cameron is clearly trying to send important messages about wildlife conservation and environmental protection, and that’s all for the good, but it’s wrapped in trite conversations and simplistic setup."
If only James Cameron had loosened his technician’s labcoat and rediscovered the joys of storytelling with the same crisply etched clarity of his images.
"An astounding, sense-defying, wonder-inspiring spectacle that takes your breath away. [Full review in Spanish]"
The action always satisfies expectations. But one thing Cameron and his co-writers can't brag about is the dialogue. [Full review in Spanish]
... All the tech advances in the world can’t hide the narrative tedium of watching Cameron’s yoked-together eco-fable unfurl over 190 minutes.
"That's the essence of ""The Way of Water"": It's sheer experience above all else, with a solid, easy-to-follow story underneath it."
"Self-referential to the end, unnecessarily self-explanatory, and self-indulgent; therein lies its sins and virtues... [Full review in Spanish]"
"In an era of visual slop from blockbusters, James Cameron’s Avatar: The Way of Water is a breathtaking technical marvel that reminds you that CGI can be a visual feast."
"Despite bordering on corn, Avatar: The Way of Water is fury, blood, blind vengeance and a Western akin to Solider Blue."
"Sea-obsessed maverick James Cameron breaks more cinematic ground providing moviegoers with a mesmerizing 3-hr, 10-min behemoth of a film that argues for love and compassion which is exactly what the world needs right now…gobsmackingly arresting filmmaking"
"Cameron was right to wait so long to release this second Avatar film, until the technology had time to advance enough to properly portray his vision."
"Cameron’s embrace of the idealism of adolescence, of the capacity for moral outrage as well as wonder, is the emotional heart of the movie."
"When Avatar 2 avoids being amazed with itself and preaching its well-intentioned ecologist and anti-imperialist propaganda by focusing on the action, it becomes pure cinema. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Dazzling, epic, and yet surprisingly intimate, Cameron's Avatar sequel expands on this exquisite world in ways both passionate and futuristic."
"It’s the combination between thrills and profound beauty that Cameron brilliantly knows how to execute, which sets Avatar: The Way of Water apart from the competition."
"A stock blockbuster filled with impressive action sequences, albeit familiar and not as definitive as was expected after 13 years, but justifiably necessary in the landscape of mimetic superheroes... [Full review in Spanish]"
"It is hyper-realistic, which is to say The Way of Water represents a significant advancement in the possibilities of special effects and immersive storytelling. It is not always a complete success, but then again, maybe we have not adjusted to it."
"It’s a stunning, visual feast, with every shot beautifully crafted via painstakingly perfect CGI. Big emotions are just as apparent throughout too, with Cameron’s storytelling pulling on our heartstrings unabashedly from beginning to end."
James Cameron’s second Avatar movie is a visually stunning but narratively uninspired return to Pandora that drowns some of its best ideas in military morass.
"If you want to go in with arms crossed and get caught up with what’s wrong with the movie, you could easily do that, but you’d have to try really hard not to have a good time in the action scenes."
"I was not only on the edge of my seat, but I'm not sure if I remembered to even draw a breath. Simply. Outstanding."
"There’s a certain look that most fiction films have, providing an invisible “barrier” between the world of the film and the audience. Cameron thinks he’s doing a service for filmgoers in removing that barrier, when in reality it undercuts the film."
The thing that I think they did a really fantastic job with was introducing these new characters ansd making us care about them.
"This film won me over… because of the action because of how breathtaking it is, because I connect with the characters this had so much going for it."
The film version of that beautiful person with no personality: Avatar 2 tries to say and do a lot but comes off as a striking shell for a lackluster core.
Its message of family and the portrayal of a strong father and mother protecting their children is refreshing.
"Avatar: The Way of Water is destined to be a classic of modern science fiction. With solid story development and characters; showing off unprecedented visual effects, and revolutionizing the cinematic experience once again. [Full review in Spanish]"
Cover your eyes if you long ago tired of work that prides itself on “world building”. Flee the building if you longer ago wearied of worlds built to the aesthetics of Roger Dean covers for 1970s Yes albums.
"The Way of Water doesn’t necessarily check all those boxes, but what it does right will offer spectators moments of awe, full-body immersion and genuine beauty."
"Looks 10, story 3. Regardless of its visual splendor from state-of-the-art effects, “Avatar: The Way of Water” is a bloated, confusing mess of a story."
