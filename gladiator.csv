review;
The individual performances are great and the images are stunning, and -- perhaps most important -- Gladiator offers an escapist quality that makes its derivative flaws seem minor.;
"Gladiator is not a bad film at all; in fact, it's visually stunning, easily the most impressive work Scott has done since ""Blade Runner."" But it is apparent that reaction to this film is splitting along a fault line called ""age.""";
This Ancient Roman swords-and-sandals epic is one of the last big-budget, grandiose Hollywood blockbusters to win Best Picture.;
Great visual spectacle and first-rate entertainment... [Full review in Spanish];
When the dust finally settled, “Gladiator” pulled off a few minor miracles. It catapulted Crowe into super-stardom, removed any doubt that Scott could work within any particular genre with success, and took a dusty old genre and made it new again.;
Gladiator benefits from a second half that is, given its focus on Maximus’ vengeance-fueled exploits, virtually overflowing with spellbinding interludes...;
The film’s most important effect, if you will, is Crowe himself as the unabashed hero General Maximus, followed closely by Joaquin Phoenix as the Emperor Commodus. Gladiator is at heart their simple story.;
It is an honorable movie, so are they all honorable movies. But that's not enough. It's not great. It's a disappointment. Caesar hates disappointment, so kill it swiftly and be done.;
The new film has spectacular fight scenes in dazzling sets and a familiar story about honor and betrayal, courage and cowardice. It's the perfect vehicle for some old-fashioned sword-clanging fun.;
"Gladiator delivers everything its title promises. The surprise is that this bold revival of the period ""sword-and-sandals"" epic does so with solid acting, sure pacing and superior style interspersed with payoff-worthy pathos.";
Such magnitude demands a heroically proportioned star, and Russell Crowe is the man, muscled but mournful and quietly spiritual. All hail, Maximus.;
Gladiator gets kudos for attempting to give a fresh face to the genre but it's merely a good, not great, film.;
The real star of the film is director Ridley Scott, who transports you from the comfort of your theater seat to the darkness that was Rome.;
The blend of digital imagery and contemporary showmanship combine to make you feel like a privileged ticket-holder at a compellingly ghastly program in the most famous arena on Earth.;
The way the movie repeatedly drives home the motivations for Phoenix's paternally scorned neurosis and Crowe's proud victim becomes repetitious; you think they could have brought some more shading to the characters in 160 minutes.
A mountain, a fever dream, an epic poem of a motion picture. Equal parts Ben-Hur and Braveheart, it is a victory not likely to be equaled any time soon.;
"Wholly improbable and voluptuously satisfying, Gladiator and its sheer shivery pleasure in cinematic spectacle and big emotion deserve a very Roman ""thumbs up.""";
"There is a plot, but it is at once so derivative and so undernourished that it never really registers as a story. As far as it goes, it's ""Spartacus Lite,"" minus that epic's moral grandeur.";
We're on the cusp of a new golden age for moviemaking. Ridley Scott is hardly equipped to light the way, but that he or anybody is willing to deliver a jolt of electricity to a genre as dead and dumb as the Roman epic is thrilling in itself.;
Gladiator isn’t awful, but it ain’t exactly a Roman holiday.;
"Fortunately, the resulting film, Gladiator, has Scott being a lot more ""on"" than he's been for a long, long time. It's a handsome-looking, testosterone-driven epic that's among the very best things he's ever produced.";
On a story level, Gladiator is solid and engaging but squarely in the dramatic tradition of its forebears. On a spectacle level, Scott's film rises to new heights of visual grandeur and visceral impact.;
This is a neatly wrought blend of two classic film categories: The historical drama and the revenge movie. Director Ridley Scott keeps the sequences wound tightly -- there's not a moment that something interesting isn't going on.;
Although Gladiator is enjoyable enough, it lacks the pop of great pop culture. Roman movies usually have preposterous scripts, but this one is preposterous and doleful.;
Crowe effortlessly projects a warrior's intelligence, as well as his unshakable belief in an ideal called Rome. Whenever Gladiator veers into a blind alley, or starts to suffer under the weight of bad writing, he comes along to steer it right.;
It is gripping stuff, with Russell Crowe so muscular and heroic in the central role and Joaquin Phoenix giving a really interesting interpretation to Commodus.;
Cinematographically important and tremendously entertaining.  [Full review in Spanish];
Gladiator doesn't strike any blows for innovation. Its plot has been cobbled together from earlier blood-and-sand epics.;
[Gladiator] succeeds on two fronts. One is the unabashed neato-ness of man-eating tigers and of warriors toiling in hand-to-hand combat. The other is the intellectual thrills exerted by the film's meticulous recreation of Rome.;
It is far from the David Lean-type epic that some of the film's producers are dubbing it, but it's far better than the mass of those 1950s-era sword-and-sandal spectacles.;
"Gladiator has the physical heft and scale of a true epic; it's seldom laughable, which is saying a lot, and reasonably entertaining.";
Scott’s slick, shallow toga party has a punier disposition: Like Braveheart, which combined carnage (for young male spectators) with a dashing, dutiful-husband hero (for their dates), Gladiator is as suburban as an SUV.;
Gladiator, directed by Ridley Scott, is enjoyable, as long as it's not taken too seriously... Everything is quite improbable, but professionally done and played to the hilt.;
"Somewhere between De Chirico and Disney, the film's Forum and Colosseum are foreshortened, overstuffed, overstylized, sternly insubstantial; it's hard to be impressed with impossible vistas that are so clearly cartoonish.";
Gladiator is a cynical exercise. It gives historical legitimacy to a pageant of mayhem every bit as ritualized as professional wrestling. It's loud, bloody and empty. The crowds will love it.;
At its best, which would be the opening 100 minutes and first two acts of Scott's two-and-a-half-hour tale of betrayal, martyrdom, and revenge, Gladiator more than satisfies our basest film-going desires.;
Overall, it's nostalgic fun to see a gladiator picture again, with all the added wizardry of computer animation techniques, but there's not a new thought in the film's head.;
Gladiator is the kind of cinema we don't see any more... It's like opening a picture book and going back to our Technicolor childhood.;
Gladiator is a terrifically embroiling movie. Like Braveheart, it is in essence a very good cowboy picture, but here there is less myth-making, less historical swaggering, and more clear-cut storytelling of the old-fashioned kind.;
Ridley Scott does a creditable job re-inventing a long neglected genre, helped in the main by Russell Crowe's brooding presence as the brilliant Roman general, done away with by the dastardly heir to the Imperial throne.;
The combat in the arena is exciting, fast but not overly gruesome -- blood is shed, tigers are unleashed, chariots career around the arena, but it's in a way that empties the gladiatorial spectacle of any sense of excess or extremes.;
Filled with several superbly choreographed action sequences as well as some very modern musings about the workings of democracy, Gladiator Is a real crowd-pleaser -- colorful, beautifully paced, exciting, and effortlessly Big.;
Crowe is a marvel as Maximus, especially considering that he seems small and rather ordinary to play the part of this towering hero of the people. But Crowe makes believers of us. He's like a character out of a fable.;
Once called to battle, Crowe commands the arena, and the movie, with intense concentration and a ferocious look in his eyes. He doesn’t just perform in Gladiator, he owns the movie like a wild animal prowling his territory.;
Plain and simple, Gladiator is a killer film, filled with everything that makes moviegoing worth the effort. It's an experience that can't be duplicated in any other format.;
Director Scott has dug deep into his bag of computer-generated imagery tricks and pulled out either the world's coolest video game or a movie that falls in on itself because of its overblown appearance and stilted dialogue.;
Gladiator refurbishes the old-school epic format. Using high-tech tools and post-modern politics, the visually dynamic director Scott turns historical fiction into bang-up excitement for the new century.;
Like Titanic and other spectacularly bloated blockbusters, the sheer grandeur and eye-popping visual style of director Ridley Scott's sweeping, revisionist and blood-drenched historical saga... is so overwhelming it disguises the film's deficiencies.;
The combat sequences are outstanding.;
No, this is not Trump in 2021, but Roman Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix is completely believable as the murderous despot) in 130 AD. Seeing this Best Picture of 2000 now brought mixed emotions.;
We came to praise Crowe, but we marched away with newfound allegiance to Phoenix.;
"Oh, to have ""original"" blockbusters back -- no franchise aspirations and nothing to sell except the star's charisma and 150 ounces of popcorn.";
With this role, Crowe establishes himself as an action star. His steely gaze rarely changes, yet he conveys the gamut of emotions. His physicality makes the battle scenes a muscular delight.;
Gladiator is a sword and saddle epic for the ages and one of Ridley Scott's most terrific cinematic achievements.;
Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix are phenomenal in Ridley Scott's thrilling gran epic of war, family and history. [Full review in Spanish];
One of the defining films of the 2000's, Gladiator might also be the first epic piece of blockbuster American cinema released in the 21st century.;
A mesmerizing, vastly updated take on ancient barbarism clashing with politics, betrayal, and vengeance.;
In general, a handsome film, and it is, in general, a rousing spectacle, albeit one that has needlessly compromised the action scenes that ought to be its strongest selling point.;
"Gladiator... is popcorn entertainment at its most polished and exciting; the film is responsible for a renewed interest in antiquity and was, somewhat unsurprisingly, incredibly influential.";
Gladiator is timeless popular cinema -- an event, an experience, and above all else, an epic not to be forgotten.;
It wields its religiosity, and its democratic morality, with the subtlety of a broadsword. But this is a ferociously entertaining spectacle, with thrilling action sequences, eye-popping art direction and uniformly powerful performances.;
Ridley Scott takes an age-old formula and utilises it remarkably well, enhancing but never over-doing it with digital effects that help raise the ruins of the Colosseum and capture the magnificence and casual brutality of the culture.;
Gladiator certainly feels like it was written by committee and template.;
Russell Crowe solidly anchors this epic-scale gladiator movie - the first in nearly four decades - by using his burly frame and expressive face to give dimension to what might otherwise have been comic book heroics.;
It is monumental movie-making: visually thrilling, technically astonishing, and emotionally engaging.;
The film presents itself as worthy, but it's ultimately boring. [Full Review in Spanish];
By returning to basics, Ridley Scott's Gladiator deploys the oft-transposed genre in the way it was originally intended.;
Russell Crowe as Maximus has the charismatic glower of a true star. If you have to introduce an entirely new generation to a big, bloody and very dicey old movie form, you can do a lot worse than giving them Gladiator.;
A movie initially intended as summer popcorn, but which somehow scored a Best Picture Oscar: the only one of Scott's lengthy and impressive canon to have done so.;
"It took ""Alien"" director Ridley Scott to reinvigorate, however briefly, the sword and sandal genre at the turn of the 21st century.";
The journey of Maximus, from triumph on the battlefield through despair and degradation in slavery and then to a final epiphany in the Colosseum is an exciting one -- and Russell Crowe plays the character with considerable toughness and authority.;
Maximus has honor and purpose, either missing from or poorly fabricated by today's actor-athletes. That makes all the difference. Therefore, Gladiator has the distinction of being both timely and nostalgic.;
This may be fundamentally Saturday night entertainment, but Scott attempts rather more than that on occasion, and at least succeeds in creating a memorable sense of a dark and often frightening period of time.;
"Throughout it all, Crowe maintains a tough, slot-mouthed reticence; he is very persuasive as the superman of the Colosseum.";
In Russell Crowe, Scott has found an actor who can carry this movie the way Atlas was supposed to carry the globe of the world on his back -- in Crowe's case without stooping.;
Crowe is perfect for the role, creating a character that will quickly gain your sympathies.;
Gladiator is a remarkable spectacle of unforgivable length.;
"Despite its big battle scenes and epic craftsmanship, Ridley Scott's Gladiator lacks the spirit and the true heart of a legendary epic; revisit Spartacus and Ben Hur on video for the real McCoy.";
Crowe confirms his position as one of the best star character actors around.;
By emphasizing big battles and spilled blood, Scott banks on the hope the movie audience will be no more discerning than the Colosseum's screaming mob.;
Gladiator, well cast and impressively staged, is every inch the summer blockbuster it intends to be. It's also something more. Amid the action and intrigue, director Scott makes a few points about blockbuster-style entertainment.;
Rather than getting lost in the world Scott has created on screen, Scott asks filmgoers to marvel at how he created that world, and how smoothly he succeeds in manipulating us.;
Moviegoers may not have been pining for such spectacles since speeding chariots last rumbled through theaters in 1959's Ben-Hur and 1960's Spartacus, but the juiced-up Gladiator proves there's still plenty of grappa left in the genre.;
"For those old enough to remember the 70mm epics of yesteryear, this is a nostalgic synthesis of all of them. For those who haven't seen those earlier movies, Scott will open their eyes to a ""brand-new"" old world.";
Gladiator is filled with brilliant filmmaking and features outstanding performances, but it's neither profound enough nor pop enough to be great -- it's mournful, serious, beautiful and, finally, pointless.;
Ridley Scott thrusts us so close to the combat that all we see is a lot of whirling and thrashing, a sword thrust here and there, a spurt of blood, a limb severed. There's hardly a scene that is cleanly and coherently staged in open space.;
If there's a soft spot in your heart for the sword-&-sandal epic, then you'll swoon with giddy delight over Gladiator.;
Crowe doesn't use tricks in this role to court our approval. He earns it the old-fashioned way, by daring to be quiet, if not silent, and intensely, implacably strong.;
This is visceral film-making at its finest, painted on the grandest of canvases, and yet, one which maintains the finest eye for detail.;
The fusion of the ancient and the modern -- even to the point of some sly echoes of our own sports-mad society -- is seamless. Gladiator does indeed deliver the glory that was Rome, but it also clinically dissects the assumptions on which it was built.;
In the end, Gladiator is overdrawn and too insubstantial for its own good, just like the old days, but it satisfies as entertainment on a grand scale.;
Gladiator's combination of grim sanctimony and drenching, Dolby-ized dismemberings left me appalled.;
Time for a little gladiatorial gore with your Milk Duds. Gladiator is here, and it's big, glorious and eminently dumb.;
While Crowe's acting is certainly more subtle than most of the brouhaha around him, he has little chance to display the affecting humanity that's one of his chief assets.;
Really excellent but really violent Oscar winner.;
"Russell Crowe is as believable a Spaniard here as Charlton Heston was a Mexican in ""Touch of Evil."" But director Ridley Scott took greater interest in entwining an empire's intrigue with its people's turmoil than emphasizing bread-and-circus brutality.";
...stirring action, good performances, and a plethora of visual delights.;
The brutality has such a mythical grandeur that it occasionally resembles beauty.;
"Beefcake! Blood! Body slams! Boring! Boring? Well, not quite, but at 150 minutes, ""Gladiator"" isn't entirely the thrilling, action-packed Roman epic some fans of the genre were expecting.";
Epic cinema is back.;
Scott triumphantly transports us back to the Roman Empire circa 180 A.D. with a painter's eye for detail, a proven talent for manufacturing exotic realities (such as the future shock of Blade Runner) and a sweet tooth for utter spectacle.;
Meaty and satisfying.;
If a gladiator film doesn't work as spectacle or as bloodthirsty action, what's left? Drama? It's dead on that level, too...;
The film is good, at times grizzly, fun -- of epic proportions.;
Ultimately, Gladiator is an honorable and inoffensive spectacle with nothing extraordinary to recommend it.;
Though the digital effects lack the weight and conviction of their equivalents in old Cecil B. De Mille movies, Ridley Scott's sword-and-sandal epic has some of the intensity of old Hollywood in terms of storytelling, spectacle, and violence.;
A Roman version of Ben-Hur, Gladiator succeeds on only slightly more levels than it fails.;
Notwithsdanding the blood, gore, and excessive CG effects, this is an old-fashioned historical saga in the mode of other sand-and-sandals epics like Quo Vadis and The Robe, though Russell Crowe commands attention and Phoenix continues to improve as actor.;
The cast is strong (notably Nielsen as Commodus's vacillating sister, and the late Oliver Reed, unusually endearing as a gladiator owner), the pacing lively, and the sets, swordplay and Scud catapults impressive.;
"Gladiator is a movie that while watching, you can enjoy; for a while.";
There's careful thought evident in suggesting what can only be conjectured. If you're going to enjoy this entertainment, don't be overly preoccupied with historical accuracy.;
It's an exciting yarn... and does not disappoint the action junkie. It's just not great.;
Listen to the audience as they leave the theatre. Are they talking about being moved by honor and justice, or going 'wow' at the bloodshed so spectacularly delivered?;
Scott... has delivered the first Roman Empire epic in more than 30 years and it's a doozy.;
[Crowe's] commanding performance not only towers over Ridley Scott's epic adventure, but elevates it to a higher plane.;
"If no one paid attention to Russell Crowe after his stellar performances in ""The Insider"" and ""L.A. Confidential,"" they did so after he put on his Roman togs.";
While the film masks its more reactionary sentiments with the rhetoric of democracy, it's entertaining enough doubletalk.;
...One of those technically superlative, appallingly expensive, loud, sweeping, 2 1/2-hour-long epics with lots of grit and bloodlust but very little soul.;
Even when Gladiator turns nonsensical, and even when its effects shots aren't persuasive, it's hard to look away, and its 154 minutes flew by.;
Crowe and Phoenix are brilliant, as usual. The rest of the almost completely British cast are excellent, particularly with dialog that could have easily come out stilted or ridiculous.;
Bloody sword-and-sandals epic is good, but not great.;
Sweeping actioners of this nature have a tendency to often swallow up lesser actors, but Crowe, in a role just about as far removed from the pent-up but stodgy Jeffrey Wigand as possible, anchors this film with an unassailable emotional integrity.;
Though heavy on the blood-letting, Gladiator serves as a smashing kick-start to what looks like an exciting summer for fans of high-powered action movies.;
Is this thrilling to anyone?;
Scott's cinematic fiction captivated me as completely as its title character won the soul of Rome.;
Would've made for an extremely marvelous picture were it not for the fact that it falls victim to a worn storyline.;
Gladiator moves furiously through its 2.5 hours and, despite a ludicrous ending, is entertaining in its own right. Ever the visualist, Scott does reinvigorate the battle sequences of the Roman epic.;
Os inúmeros equívocos históricos poderiam ser perdoados caso o filme de Ridley Scott conseguisse sobreviver ao menos como obra de ficção. Não consegue.;
All the pieces are in place, but somehow they just don’t come together.;
Too bad, then, that any episode of Smackdown! packs a bigger wallop.;
The Roman costume drama, all dressed to the IX's, has taken a long holiday from the big screen.;
Tremendous cast. Gigantic special effects. Epic story. Same ticket price.;
The best film Ridley Scott has made... Here he's made the quintessential big-budget studio product that's smarter than it looks, a fiendishly arduous logistical feat that clicks together like a well-tailored suit of armour.;
For summer fare, it wasn't half bad.;
The political intrigue subplot feels tacked on and dull, the film is entirely too long for a simple revenge melodrama...and the structure mercilessly follows its predictable pattern...;
One of those movies 'they don't make anymore,' Gladiator is a guts and glory epic with swords and sandals, spectacular action sequences, a seriously good hero and a cast of (digitally enhanced) thousands.;
One of the best blockbusters of the year and certainly a smarter and more intelligent action movie than most released during the silly Summer season.;
So skillfully delivered is this sturm und drang... that the film's shortcomings are all but buried beneath the sheer awesome spectacle.;
Despite being a mainstream action picture with big-budget special effects, it has the gall to moralize about the effects of escapism on an unthinking citizenry. Gladiator is a two-ring circus that fails as entertainment and stinks as a sermon.;
Gladiator is a triumphant reinvention of the sword-and-sandal epic that fell out of favor decades ago.;
Thanks to a combination of real locations and convincing computer-generated effects, Scott can create sweeping vistas and that Cecil B. DeMille would envy.;
Gladiator is like an empty piñata -- a beautiful but ultimately hollow affair, promising considerably more than it delivers. Enjoy the game while it lasts, but temper it with the knowledge that transient thrills will be your only reward.;
Everything you’ve possibly heard about Crowe’s volcanic performance of a good man who has suffered unspeakable wrongs is true. He’s terrific.;
Gladiator is an old-fashioned sword-and-sandal tale with graphic violence and a slick gloss of sentimentality. It almost works.;
Thank you, lord, for Russell Crowe.;
A grand spectacle of a movie wrapped around intimate human drama.;
Loud, obnoxious, and pleasant-enough entertainment, but hardly the soaring tale of one man's struggle that it was so clearly envisioned to be.;
It's almost like [Scott]'s trying as hard as he can to make the worst movie of all time.;
This Ridley Scott film, his best in years, re-envisions ancient Rome for the aughts and makes it safe to go back in the Colosseum.;
This is the kind of movie Braveheart will someday grow up to be and it should not be missed.;
What elevates Gladiator to the near-greatness it occasionally achieves is the performance of Russell Crowe as Maximus.;
I shouldn't diminish Gladiator by tossing out so banal a word as 'entertaining' -- but it is. I shouldn't succumb to the temptation to describe it with ad-copy buzzwords like 'spectacular!' or 'dazzling!' or 'epic!' -- but it is.;
Gladiator is not the bore it might have been. But self-proclaimed “world-creator” Scott only intermittently obliterates the turgid narrative and mediocre dialogue. This revenge tragedy echoes Shakespeare and Sergio Leone but without their dramaturgy.;
Gladiator isn't bad enough to be really good... It's not blatantly ridiculous in the manner of those awful Italian-made efforts cable TV carries in the wee hours, but neither has it the dramatic weight to be taken seriously.;
With its conspicuous display of prefascist trappings, it says more about our time than about Rome.;
Scott largely prevails, arousing you with slaughter, leaving the guilt for someone else to fret over, like Crowe, who transforms the rage roiling in Maximus into unmitigated pain. There's a patois in his voice, and it's called revenge.;
Ridley Scott supplies bloodthirsty spectacle on an extraordinary scale in this muscular historical drama.;
Director Scott gives them all [characters] a big tapestry, one that borders on the mythological. Their combined talents fill it admirably.;
With a few reservations for [Ridley] Scott's visual style this is pleasant return of a type of film we have not seen made since the '60s.;
The sheer dynamism of the action, coupled with Hans Zimmer's lavish score and the forcefield of Crowe, still makes this a fiercesome competitor in the summer movie stakes.;
Had the filmmakers been daring enough to make the movie without its clunky dialogue or without digital filler, Gladiator could have been epic in more ways than its running time.;
Gladiator is a cheese-ball colossus.;
It's a violent, noisy, low-brow distraction.;
Gladiator can aptly be called a typical summer movie, meaning it is mindless and designed for the lowest common denominator.;
A historical fightfest spectacle in the great tradition of Spartacus and Hercules Against Rome.;
For all the added scale and detail ... Ridley Scott's movie lacks human warmth and spontaneity. Instead, Gladiator feels impersonal and overly programmed.;
Gladiator suggests what would happen if someone made a movie of the imminent extreme-football league and shot it as if it were a Chanel commercial.;
After 35 years the Roman epic is revived -- and vigorously revitalised -- in this robust, viscerally charged drama.;
Given new life by digital technology that's used to create the proverbial cast of thousands, the Roman epic returns with a viscerally drawn exclamation point.;
In the glorious spectacle Gladiator, director Ridley Scott [re-creates] -- with a startling physicality and immediacy -- the Roman Empire that once blanketed most of Europe.;
Essentially what we get is pure Crowe, and that's something to crow about.;
Visually stimulating.;
The movie's production values are peerless.;
At its best, Gladiator is one of the great films of all time.;
A truly transporting trip back nearly 2,000 years.;
"If this review were limited to two words, these words would reflect the grandiloquent gesture of the 50,000 spectators in the Roman Colosseum: ""Pollice sursum."" Thumbs up.";
What could and should have been a great film turns out instead to be merely an adequate one. Only the film's look and Crowe's usually wonderful performance causes it to rise above the ordinary.;
Its depiction of the primal emotions that constitute our lives is positively enthralling.;
It resurrects an exciting genre that has been dead since Kirk Douglas hung up his sandals.;
A refreshing (and much-anticipated) return to the world of some of the most astounding warriors ever known.;
Gladiator has all the fixin's for wonderful drama.;
It may bear some flaws and familiar elements, but Gladiator's script is a great story well told, evading the clichés one might expect...and staying completely one-liner free.;
A movie that revels in the primal thrill of swords tearing into flesh and blood spraying in huge, arterial gouts.;
Scott gets strong performances from nearly everyone in the cast. Crowe is a great one for the slow boil that leads to a vicious outburst.;
As gory and gaudy escapism, it is impressive.;
Gladiator is too long, too pretentious, too ambitious and too bloody, but it lingers in the boldness of its scope. Much like ancient Rome itself, actually.;
A joyous return of the cinematic epic.;
Grip your theater seats and prepare to be entertained.;
This is a big, all-stops-out blockbuster and it delivers.;
Huge in scope and endlessly exciting, Gladiator is the new word in blockbuster.;
A smart blend of classic heroism and intelligent drama.;
Great performances from Crowe and Phoenix.;
Savage, sweeping, spectacular.;
"""Gladiator"" does best what it proposes - it be's big!";
Gladiator isn't groundbreaking, but it's good old-fashioned entertainment.;
Spectacle and human drama interweave beautifully in this epic recreation of the spirit of ancient Rome in all its pomp, splendor, and horror.;
Gladiator is a flawed motion picture, and one that, for all its flashiness, comes off as a mild disappointment. It is still a good film, but only marginally so, and easily could have been a great one.;
Gladiator, though, is Crowe’s to win or lose -- Caesar’s thumb up or thumb down, as it were. And he wins, colossally.;
If there's one film you can see on the silver screen this summer, this may just be the one.;
Highly visual entertainment with lots of blood and action.;
Gladiator is visually magnificent, absolutely stunning to look at -- and to listen to, with its haunting, stirring score.;
Gladiator looms as an audacious, if not exactly great, movie. Scott not only revives a genre that was thought of as dead, but brings a decided social consciousness to the material... The novelty of it alone should make Gladiator into a huge hit.;
An extravaganza of grand design, superb acting, deft direction, and terrific sound and scoring, but the entire course of the movie has been apparent from the opening minutes. Thus, the soul of Gladiator is made sluggish by a maddening lack of suspense.;
The most visually spectacular of all Roman Empire epics.;
Gladiator is quite a good movie -- a big, fat, rousing, intelligent, daring, retro, many-adjective-requiring entertainment.;
Vibrant, visceral, provocative and transporting.;
The film looks muddy, fuzzy and indistinct.;
There's something Jerry Springeresque about Gladiator.;
Gladiator is a canned experience, a film that flails around awkwardly trying to find a reason to exist.;
The biggest disappointment is that even though Gladiator pours on the usual Caesar dressing, it skimps on the heart-stirring, spirit-lifting emotions of its predecessors.;
This tale of power and revenge proves that there are still some people in the movie business who know what they're doing.;
Ridley Scott's Gladiator is an interesting and attractive action movie, but not a very forceful one.;
Scott shows that a strong Gladiator can still entertain the crowd.;
A real winner.;
A visually astonishing picture that brings script, performance and, alas, displays of violence up to the modern standard.;
Crowe’s brooding melancholy is matched with his riveting physical presence and a grubby intensity. But it’s Phoenix’s bravado turn as the saturnine weasel Commodus that delivers the biggest surprise in the cast.;
Without Russell Crowe's dynamism holding it all together, Gladiator might have devolved into a rash of overblown pandering.;
"If you enjoy visceral (and I mean visceral) action, crowd-whooping heroics and stirring acts of resistance against tyranny, if the aphorism ""hack or be hacked"" rings true, then Gladiator is one extended guilty pleasure.";
A beautiful looking piece of work, dampened only by its leisurely pace and Phoenix’s casting, and is the first step in the right direction to bringing the Ancient Epic Genre back into power.;
Simply the most satisfying and invigorating big-budget summer event movie in years.;
;
While Gladiator is nothing if not stimulating and richly visual, director Ridley Scott's sense of grandeur is inconsistent, and he often over-reaches in his attempts to modernize the storytelling for MTV audiences.;
If you like gory movies, this is the film for you.;
A clever cast.;
Gladiator delivers the classic goods.;
Ridley Scott may not have created the perfect epic, but he came awfully close.;
This is filmmaking on a grand scale.;
An exhilarating, sweeping epic that begs to be seen on the largest possible screen.;
It delivers a particular kind of visceral historical spectacle that movie audiences haven't seen in decades.;
it's a smashing metaphor for the mesmerising politics of showbiz. Gladiator excels at the task that draws us to the arena in the first place.;
Action movie fans will love Gladiator for its intensity. Those looking for something more intelligent will find moments of satisfaction here, but will wish it had more of a theme than 'revenge is sweet.';
If Gladiator stops well short of being a classic, it nonetheless offers moments of spectacle that linger long past the movie's two-and-a-half-hour running time.;
From the spectacular opening battle scene ... to a final mano-a-mano showdown in the Coliseum, this film is at its best when it's at its bloodiest.;
Gladiator is an epic, primal panorama of good versus evil.;
Gladiator derides 'entertainment' while hustling like crazy to provide two and a half hours' worth of same. The heroism and the tigers and the epic grandeur all leave behind the flavor of cynicism.;
[Ridley Scott] pays homage to Spartacus, the greatest Roman-era movie of all, sometimes by emulating it and sometimes by flat-out stealing from it. Though the results fall shy, he has created a solid but gory addition to the genre.;
Clever exploration of the notion of 'spectatorship.';
Scott's work is almost always intelligent, slick and highly professional, but this will certainly raise his reputation and salary. There's nary a dull moment in the film, which seems far shorter than its 2.5 hours.;
One more example of why cinema is considered the Seventh Art. [Full Review in Spanish];
There's little room for neutral territory with this one. You're either going to love or hate Gladiator.;
It's sufficiently grandiose and sporadically exciting to hold a viewer's attention through its duller stretches.;
As the so-called American Century concludes, it's hard not to see some of this country's strengths and weaknesses echoed in Commodus's declining Roman Empire. And director Ridley Scott subtly amplifies these ideas.;
A triumph!;
Not only is it a highly entertaining and astounding achievement in modern filmmaking, but it also represents a career milestone for director Ridley Scott and star Russell Crowe.;
Gladiator isn’t particularly deep, and it’s not as thrilling as more entertainment-minded action movies are, but it has real grandeur, and that’s thrilling in its own way.;
Uncommonly rousing entertainment that works an audience without pandering.;
God knows copycat producers are already developing various incarnations of this film for next summer, but this will surely be the one to remember.;
Action-packed and passionate, the new film deals in broad strokes and flashy theatrics. But its melodramatic narrative has a surprising emotional richness. And its larger-than-life figures are never so large that they stop seeming human.;
A future classic.;
With digital technology in full flower, Ridley Scott's Gladiator brings back the glory that was Rome. It has never before looked so densely opulent or extravagantly decadent.;
From battling armies, to duels to the death, Gladiator is impressive (though bloody) to watch.;
It is undeniably a triumph, muscular and entertaining.;
This film is the first 'sword-and-sandal' epic since the mid-1960s.;
Gladiator is what championship is all about. Thrilling and exciting, it embraces technical standards of filmmaking rarely anticipated in earlier epics.;
The problem with Gladiator is that Scott is so good at creating alternate universes that he hates to leave and overstays his welcome. Too long at a full two and a half hours, Gladiator is not as nimble outside the arena as inside.;
"Like its hero, the film is solemnly pious; and though Christianity this time is noticeably missing from Hollywood's Rome, the sense of morality oppresses as never before.";
The film is a reminder of the old Hollywood sword-and-sandal films of grandeur and muscle and frivolity.;
